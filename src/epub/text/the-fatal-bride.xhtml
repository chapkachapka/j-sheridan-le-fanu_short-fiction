				<h2 epub:type="title">The Fatal Bride</h2>
				<p epub:type="subtitle">Being a Second Contribution from the Reminiscences of a Bachelor.</p>
			</hgroup>

<p>I am now an old man, and, what is perhaps less excusable, an old bachelor too;
and yet, sir, I am not a bachelor of
<i>malice prepense</i>-I am no profane railer
against wedlock. I would not, for
my grandmother's enamel <i>bonbonniere</i>,
which catches my eye this moment,
nor for my honoured uncle's silver-mounted and inlaid steel barrels-both
of them family reliques dear in their own
several ways-that your fair readers
should set me down as guilty of premeditated and deliberate celibacy. No
such thing. I have more than once
narrowly escaped--I should say <i>missed</i>--the fate-matrimonial, and that by
pure accident by no cowardice or
perfidy of mine. No; my tendencies
were all conjugal - my blessedness,
however, has been single; and so far am
I from thanking my stars, or taking
merit to myself for this state of things,
that, sooth to say, even the seventy-and-five winters and summers that
have bleached and baked me in succession, still find me, now and then, sighing over the tender recollections and
bitter disappointments, which are now
for me, the sad and only reliques of the
romance of early days.</p>

<p>But though I have had my passages
of love, as well as those of the sterner
passions, in my day; and though I
sometimes take a whim to rummage
among old trinkets, lockets, and likenesses, each of them to me a little
history in itself, yet I would not have
you suppose me a superannuated sentimentalist either. No, sir. I have my
tender, and, jesting aside, my melancholy retrospections; but I have also
my pleasant, and, even at this time of
day, my exciting recollections, too. I
would be almost ashamed to tell you
how often it comes to pass, that, my
solitary pint of old port finished, I find
myself sunk in my comfortable, ancient,
leathern chair, gazing between my
knees into the clear red embers, between which and me are rising and
floating, like mystic shapes from an enchanted caldron, the forms and faces
long lost to life, which have mingled in
the mazes of early adventure; and some
of whom have left upon my time-chilled heart, traces that eternity itself,
mayhap, will fail to obliterate.</p>

<p>Thus it is, that in long winter's
evenings, as I sit alone and musing,
memory calls up, with chastened colouring and softened outline, the chequered past before me. Passive, as
though the pageant were the creation
of some Prospero, and I his wondering visitor, I sit by and see, while memory and association crowd my vision
with their filmy troops, fragments of
old adventure, and glimpses of thrilling
scenes, with all their actors duly accoutred, and looking just as they did—
how many years ago! The light-hearted
and the moody-the loved and the
worthless the prosperous and the
ruined the changed, and the dead and
gone-all, in defiance of time and death,
take their old places, and wear their old
looks and liveries, as they drift by me in
sad and wayward procession. Leaving
these recollections to themselves, to
rise, and shift, and unroll before my
listless gaze, as chance, or some unknown law of suggestion wills it, it often happens that strange occurrences,
and striking and mournful histories,
which had passed from my ordinary
remembrances, are thrown up again,
like long-buried treasures from the
restless sea, and startle me almost with
the vividness of novelty.</p>

<p>It may be, that feeling, in most of
these stories, that interest which attaches to an acquaintance with the individuals who have taken a part in
them, I am unduly predisposed to exaggerate the degree of favour with
which an ordinary reader may be presumed to regard them. Incidents well
worth recording, as having happened to
my lord or lady this, that, or t'other,
may yet prove dull enough in the abstract, and unsupported by the borrowed importance of the aforesaid
distinguished titles. But whatever interest I might have thrown over these
pages, by particularizing individuals,
and publishing real names, I feel bound--in some cases by humanity, in others
by honour, but in <em>all</em> effectually--to
forego. A <i>chronique scandaleuse</i> is
not quite the thing for your respectable pages, nor, independently of
other and higher considerations, are
the tease and worry to which such
authorship would expose your humble
servant, quite the thing for an easy
old bachelor, who has not handled a
pistol in anger for full five-and-thirty
years, who wishes well to all mankind,
and hates trouble, almost as much as
law or bloodshed.</p>

<p>The tales I send you, therefore,
shall not record the names of those
whose acts, follies, or sufferings, they
recite. In all other respects they
shall be faithful narratives of fact-in
this alone fictitious. They may prove
wondrous dull, as old men's stories
sometimes do. Of their merits, I am,
for every reason, the worst possible
judge. Decide, then, yourself-put
them into your Magazine or into your
fire, just as your critical acumen shall
determine. As for me, I prize my
snug obscurity too justly to aspire to
literary honours, or to participate in
literary resentments. Blot, burn, or
print, just as you please; I have
nothing of the <i>genus irritabile</i>, except, perhaps, some symptoms of the
<i>cacoëthes scribendi</i> about me.
I perceive, indeed, with complacency, that
you have admitted my former contribution to a place in your November
number; this has determined me to
despatch another, which, with like encouragement, may be followed by a
third, and so on; I, all the while, with
your good leave, maintaining my incognito, and despatching my scribblings through that mysterious agency,
the penny-post. Should you cease to
hear from me, without sufficient ap.
parent cause for the suspension of my
correspondence; should, I say, this
series for such, with your permission, I mean to make it-be abruptly
and finally cut short, why then you
may conclude that the "brief candle,"
in whose flickering light I ply this my
self-imposed task, has at last gone out,
and left your old and unknown correspondent to the darkness and repose
to which time is hurrying us all.</p>

<p>With these few preliminary remarks, now offered once for all, I shall
end the tedious task of introduction,
and plunge at once into the business
of my story, merely reiterating, by
way of supplemental caution, that
names and titles, and a few details of
locality, which I fancied might indicate individuals, and lead to detection,
have been suppressed and altered;
but that in the substance, and, indeed,
with those exceptions, in all the minor
details of these narratives, I shall observe a strict adherence to the facts,
as they were either related to me, or
came within my own personal knowledge.</p>

<p>The story which I am about to relate, carries me back somewhere about
half a century; at which time, it is
needless to say, Dublin was, in point
of society, a very different city from
what it now is. It had then a resident aristocracy, and one whose equipages and housekeeping were maintained upon a scale which put plebeian competition wholly out of the
question. I do not mean to offer any
ungracious reflections upon the existing state of Dublin society. We have
now, alas! more tuft-hunters than
tufts to boast of; magnificent pretensions, based, like the Brahmin's world,
nobody can exactly say upon what,
strive and strain to fill the void,
which a legitimate aristocracy have
left; and men, whose grandfathers--but what matters it? the thing is after
all but natural. What was a metropolis, is a capital no longer; and it is
but lost time sighing after the things
that once were, or snarling at those
that are.</p>

<p>At the time of which I speak, there
resided in Dublin a certain worthy
baronet, whom I shall call Sir Arthur
Chadleigh. He was then considerably
past sixty, and was a venerable monument of what was called hard living, in
all its departments. He had been,
until gout disabled him, a knowing
gentleman on the turf; he was a deep
player and a deep drinker, and covered,
with an exterior of boisterous jollity,
a very cold and selfish heart. He was
thoroughly a man of the world, and
what was then an essential ingredient
in that amiable character, whenever
occasion prompted, a very determined
duellist. Whatever good nature he
was possessed of, was expended upon
society at large. In his dealings with
his own family, he was arbitrary and
severe; and if he did possess any natural affections, he had managed to get
them all admirably under control, and
never was known, under any circumstances, to suffer from their over-indulgence. This old gentleman had been
blessed, in his prime, with an helpmate; but Lady Chadleigh, having
been, in her own way, about as domestic a person as Sir Arthur, one
fine morning, at three o'clock precisely, when her spouse was entering
upon his fourth bottle of claret in the
parlour, absconded with young Lord
Kildalkin. The happy pair were
overtaken at Havre by the baronet,
who, at ten paces, duly measured, shot
off Kildalkin's thumb-a feat which
satisfied his honour, as some of the
sterner brethren of the hair-trigger
averred, at much too reasonable a
rate. The worthy baronet, however,
on his return, explained satisfactorily
to a select circle of friends. "For,"
said he, "had I shot him through the
head, I should not have known what
the to do with Lady C." As it
was, he left his wife in the hands of
his rival, as a moderate equivalent for
the joint.</p>

<p>Lady Chadleigh had not been cruel
enough to leave her lord without
some objects on which to exercise
those domestic virtues, for which he
was so justly celebrated. She had
been just five years married, when she
took her departure, as I have stated;
and she left behind her, for the consolation of her spouse, along with an
extensive assortment of macaws,
avadavats, lap-dogs, and other sundries, three children-two sons and a
girl. The macaws, &c., were easily
disposed of, but there was no getting
rid of the children; so Sir Arthur
called in a grim old spinster sister,
who, for fourteen years, dating from
that day, presided at the baronet's
tea-table, and ruled his little flock.
At the end of this period she died,
and much about the same time died
also the unfortunate Lady Chadleigh,
forsaken and heart-broken, in some
obscure town in France.</p>

<p>Lady Chadleigh's name had been
proscribed in Sir Arthur's presence
none dared to mention it; and, with
the exception of little Mary, the
daughter who, since infancy, had
never seen her, no human being appeared to feel the smallest concern
about the event. Little Mary Chadleigh, however, felt it deeply; with
the yearnings of unavailing affection,
she had always clung to the idea, that
some time or other her mother would
come back, and be fond of her. The reasons of the separation were, of course,
wholly unknown to her, and her childish eagerness to learn something of
her mother, had been systematically
repulsed with a mysterious discouragement, in which she had come gradually
to acquiesce. But though she had
long learned to look upon her mother's
absence as in some way a necessary
and unavoidable privation, and even
as a natural thing, and a matter of
course, which scarcely required to be
accounted for, yet her mind had been
constantly busied with the one thought,
that at last she would return, and love
her as she wished to be loved. And
now came these strange tidings, never
looked for in her childish dreams, and
these black dresses, to tell her that all
the little plans and hopes that had silently fluttered her innocent heart so many
a time for so many years, must end for
ever; that the being for whose return
she had been watching and wishing ever
since she could remember, was never
to come again. This was a sore shock
to the poor girl, and she wept, in the
solitude of her chamber, over this, to
her, most bitter calamity, with a vehemence of grief and a sense of desolation, which, to one unacquainted with
the cherished reveries, the castle-building of the heart, which had been
her secret happiness from earliest
childhood, would have been unaccountable.</p>

<p>Years passed on--new objects and
associations began to fill her reveries;
her secret sorrow wore away, and this
early grief became but a sad, and
scarcely unpleasing remembrance. I
was a very young man when first I
saw Miss Chadleigh, and I have seldom been so much struck by any combination of beauty, grace, and expression, as when she entered the room
at one of Lady ----'s balls. She was
at this time about nineteen, beautifully
formed, and with the bearing of natural nobility; her complexion was
clear, and rather pale; her eyes dark
and lustrous; and her features, as I
thought, exquisitely beautiful. The
prevailing expression of her face was
melancholy, with perhaps some slight
character of haughtiness; but when
she smiled, there was such a rippling
of dimples, such an arch merriment in
her lovely eyes, and such a revelation
of little, even, pearly teeth, as made
her perfectly enchanting. "Well,"
thought I, as I watched with absolute
fascination the movements of this
lovely being, "if beauty the most enchanting be any longer the potent
influence it once was, there is no
scheme of ambition to whose realization such loveliness as yours may not
aspire." How little did I dream of
what was coming!</p>

<p>I was so much attracted my in-
terest and attention so irresistibly
engaged, by this beautiful girl, that I
observed her, with scarcely any inter-
mission, during the entire evening.
It would be ridiculous to say that I
was actually in love; I was not absurd
or romantic enough (which you will) to
get up a sentimental and hopeless pas-
sion at a moment's notice, and that, too,
without having exchanged one word
with the object of my aspirations. No
such thing. The feeling with which I
gazed on Miss Chadleigh, was one of
the profoundest admiration, I admit,
yet untinctured with any, the least,
admixture of actual tenderness. I
observed her with the deep and silent
pleasure with which beauty of the
highest order may be contemplated,
without the smallest danger to the
heart; and, indeed, of the philosophi-
cal nature of my admiration, I had
full assurance in the fact, that I re-
marked, with hardly one flutter of jea-
lousy, the attentions, evidently not ill-
received, which were devotedly paid
her by a singularly handsome young
officer, in a perfectly irresistible cavalry
uniform. This gentleman was the
afterwards too-celebrated Captain
Jennings.</p>

<p>That evening remains impressed
upon my memory with the vividness--what do I say ?--with fifty times the
vividness of yesterday. I think I see
old Sir Arthur now, as he sat at the
whist-table, with his crutch beside
him for gout had claimed him as its
own his fiery face and heavy brows,
overcast with the profound calcula-
tions of his favourite game, and his
massive frame, shaking all over with
the stentorian chuckle with which he
greeted the conclusion of each success-
ful rubber, while he slyly pocketed the
guineas, and rallied and quizzed his
discomfited opponents, with ferocious
good-humour. I looked at this old
man with some curiosity. I had ne-
ver seen him before, and in his past
life were not a few passages of vicissi-
tude, daring, and adventure, such as
might well warrant that qualified de-
gree of interest which, as a young
man, I not unnaturally felt in him.
As I observed this hero of a hundred
stories in the gossip of the day-his
massive, but now crippled form-his
bloated face, in which few could have
traced a vestige of the handsome traits
which rumour assigned to his early
youth, and upon which, in the inter-
vals of his tempestuous good-humour,
I thought I could clearly discover the
stamp of those sterner and imperious
attributes with which general report
had invested him;-as I looked on
this fierce, crafty, intemperate, but at
the same time, strangely enough, by
no means unpopular man of the
world, it was impossible to avoid the
trite but natural contrast which, in a
thousand such cases, is forced upon
the mind, as often as, turning from
him, my eye rested upon his beautiful
child. How could a creature so ex-
quisitely lovely, so accomplished in
every natural grace-and, if expres-
sion might be trusted, at once so re-
fined, so noble, and so sensitive-have
ever sprung from a root so gnarled,
bitter, and unsightly! Yet his child
she doubtless was; for the world, with
all its jealous and censorious curiosity,
had never once questioned the paren-
tage of Sir Arthur's children, and in
this the world was right. For poor
Lady Chadleigh had begun her mar-
ried life a good and faithful wife, and
under circumstances less unhappy,
might have been pure and honoured to
the last. But the insults of callous
profligacy had alienated and exaspe-
rated a heart at once proud and impe-
tuous. She had been a spoiled child,
and became a ruined woman. Habi-
tually ungoverned, she was incapable
of forbearance. With little principle
and less prudence, she suffered a rest-
less sense of wrong to hurry her into
extravagances of conduct-intended,
but without effect, to pique Sir Ar-
thur, and wound at least his pride into
jealousy; and in this mad enterprise
the unhappy woman had at last effec-
tually compromised herself, and was
forced to the terrible necessity of
flight. Her fall was not that of an
impure, but of a vengeful spirit. It
was the act of a bitter and passionate
suicide, who would squander fifty lives
to bring home one pang of remorse, or
any other feeling, to the heart of callous
indifference. Poor thing! the world
understood her character, and de-
spised her; for want of a due contempt
for Sir Arthur's apathy, and a proper
acquiescence in his profligate courses,
she had given herself to ruin.</p>

<p>"Who is that officer," I asked a
friend, whom accident brought close
to me in the crowded room-" that
good-looking fellow, who has been so
marked in his devotions to Miss Chad-
leigh all the evening?"</p>

<p>"Oh! that--don't you know?" he
replied. "Why that is Captain Jennings--Jennings the <i>aid-de-camp</i>--a devilish handsome fellow; the women are quite mad about him, and he
knows it."</p>

<p>"Miss Chadleigh appears intimate
with him," I observed.</p>

<p>"Yes, so she is; he was a friend of
young Chadleigh's, who died, or was
taken in some battle in India," he answered.</p>

<p>"So, one of her brothers is dead,
then?" I interrupted.</p>

<p>"Yes; I believe the native army
made him a prisoner, and treated him
in the usual way," replied he. "I
heard the particulars; they were
deuced horrid; but I don't quite recollect them now."</p>

<p>"And, Miss Chadleigh-has not
she a second brother?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"A second brother! Yes," he answered. "A pleasant fellow; but a
perfect devil for wildness. She was
fond of the other brother, and in a
sad way, I believe, when the news
came; but that is a year and a-half
since. There, now, you can see young
Chadleigh the young man going to
take Miss Chadleigh away."</p>

<p>He nodded to indicate the party,
and I followed the direction of his
eye.</p>

<p>Young Chadleigh was a decidedly
well-looking man, with a frank and
rather distinguished air, and dressed
with an almost foppish attention to the
prevailing fashion. I had just time
to observe that he and Jennings chat-
ted familiarly for a minute or two, and
appeared to be on the friendliest terms
of intimacy.</p>

<p>"Well," thought I, "after all, he
may be but a friend."</p>

<p>Whether it be impossible to con-
template such beauty as Miss Chad-
leigh's with perfect stoicism, and that,
without knowing it, I was really a lit-
tle jealous, I can't say; but I certainly
had watched the young captain's at-
tentions with a slight but disagreeable
sense of restlessness, and experienced,
I know not how, a certain relief in the
reflection I had just made. It had,
however, hardly visited my mind, when
it was again disturbed.</p>

<p>Miss Chadleigh, leaning on her bro-
ther's arm, was passing so close as al-
most to touch me, whom she had un-
consciously inspired with so much ad-
miration, when Jennings, following,
presented her with her fan, accidentally
forgotten. As she took it with a gra-
cious smile, she blushed. Yes, I could
not be mistaken, for a more beautiful
blush I never beheld in my existence;
and, to make the matter worse, I
thought I perceived that, as he placed
the light weapon of coquetry in her
hand, his own rested upon her's for a
second longer than was strictly neces-
sary, and in doing so conveyed the
slightest possible <em>pressure</em> to her little
ivory fingers. I felt, I know not how,
disposed to be affronted and incensed,
and actually stared, with no very in-
viting expression, full upon Captain
Jennings, as he made his retreat, with
a lurking smile of vanity and triumph
on his lip. My ill-bred stare was un-
observed, and I could, on reflection,
scarcely help laughing at the absur-
dity of the emotion which had inspired
it. But, after all, why should I?-the
nature of the beast pervades us all.
The presence of beauty is a woeful
stimulus to unprovoked combativeness,
and I do believe there is a lurking idea
universally in the mind of man, that
beauty should be, somehow, the prize
of the fiercest and strongest-the</p>

<p><span>"Viribus editior ut in grege taurus."</span></p>

<p>I know it was ever the case with
me I never saw, at least in my young
days, a pretty girl, without feeling a
disposition to fight with somebody-
and this, although, under ordinary
circumstances, as peaceable a fellow
as any among her majesty's liege
subjects.</p>

<p>In pursuing this narrative, I am
forced occasionally to rely upon the
report of others; in some of its odd.
est scenes, however, as the reader
will perceive, I was present, and my-
self a secondary actor. What I did not
myself witness, I shall, as I have said,
supply from the testimony of others,
and thus present your readers with a
connected recital of this eccentric
piece of Irish biography.</p>

<p>If fortune had condemned Captain
Jennings to the torments of love, she
was, at all events, resolved to grant
him every reasonable mitigation in his
distressed condition. For upwards of
a month, during that summer, he had
the happiness of being a guest at Lord
's, where Miss Chadleigh and
her brother were also visitors; whe-
ther he had succeeded, or not, in
making any impression upon the young
lady's heart, was not then known; but
as his attentions were, if possible,
more marked and devoted than ever,
the affair began to be talked of, and,
soon after this visit terminated, was
mentioned by a friend to Sir Arthur
himself.</p>

<p>The baronet forthwith instituted in-
quiries respecting Captain Jennings'
ways and means-the result was un-
satisfactory-and, one day, as the gay
young gentleman sat chatting, at an
early visit, with Chadleigh and his fair
sister, the old baronet hobbled into
the room, and set himself down as
one of the party—a procedure quite
contrary to his ordinary habits. There
was nothing ominous in his counte-
nance and bearing, however; on the
contrary, he seemed more than usu-
ally frank and good-humoured, shook
Jennings more heartily by the hand,
and laughed more boisterously at all
his jokes and stories than ever he had
done before. Chadleigh had already
gone, and Sir Arthur having dis
patched Mary to superintend some
customary arrangements affecting his
own comforts, the door was closed
upon him and Captain Jennings.</p>

<p>"Jennings," said the baronet.</p>

<p>"Well, sir."</p>

<p>"You're a devilish good fellow--
Jennings, a devilish pleasant fellow,"
said the baronet, "and I've no doubt
will get on in the world-with <em>prudence</em>, that is, with <em>prudence</em>."</p>

<p>Jennings bowed his acknowledgments, and looked a little surprised.</p>

<p>"And, as it strikes me, Jennings,
my boy," continued the baronet, in
the same jolly tone-" about the most
imprudent thing you could possibly
do, at the outset, would be to <em>marry</em>;
and marriage being out of the ques-
tion in point of prudence-totally and
entirely out of the question-I should
not, you understand me, like to have
Miss Chadleigh, my daughter, talked
of in connexion with such an absurdity."</p>

<p>"Really, Sir Arthur," interrupted
Jennings, changing colour slightly,
and affecting a cool <i>hauteur</i>, which
he was far from feeling--"I don't precisely know to what particular circumstances you are pleased to allude."</p>

<p>"Come, come, my dear fellow,"
said Sir Arthur, in the same tone of
rough good humour, which, in all his
dealings, alike with friend or foe,
whether with the dice-box or the
pistol, he had ever maintained-" we
are, both of us, men of the world-
eh? I an old, and you a young one;
but both of us unquestionably men of
the world, and perfectly wide awake.
You know just as well as <em>I</em>, and <em>I</em> as
well as <em>you</em>, what is usually termed,
<em>paying attentions to a young lady</em>--let
us have no shamming at either side--we both of us know this; and I don't
approve of Miss Chadleigh's receiving
any such distinction from <em>you</em>, my
dear Jennings; and now I hope I have
made myself perfectly intelligible."</p>

<p>Jennings bowed stiffly, and the baronet continued--</p>

<p>"A set of meddling old women have
begun to talk, you see, and I took this,
the earliest opportunity, of putting you
on your guard-for, of course, it
would not answer your cards either,
to have such nonsense put about, and
so, without anything abrupt or re-
markable, your acquaintance must be-
come cooler, and-and-more distant;
and, in short, when you do happen to
meet in society, the less you are thrown
together, the better; in a word, my
dear Jennings, your coolness must
effectually give the lie to this ridicu
lous piece of gossip."</p>

<p>As Sir Arthur concluded, he was
slowly rising from his seat, and hav-
ing, just at its termination, established
his ponderous and gouty person in an
erect position, he took Jennings' hands
in both his, and shaking them very
cordially, said, in precisely the tone
which might have conveyed a hospita
ble and pressing invitation--</p>

<p>"And, by the way, my dear Jennings, I think it would be very advisable, don't you, by way of a beginning, to put an immediate stop to
these little visits-these foolish little
morning calls, which make people
talk, and serve no possible purpose,
as matters stand, except as a very unnecessary tax upon your time; so, for
the future"--here he renewed the
shaking, with increasing warmth--"when we <em>do</em> meet, let it be abroad,
my dear Jennings, and not here; you
understand me, not on any account
here; in society, of course, I shall
always be delighted to meet you; we
shall there, of course, be the best
possible friends; and now, my dear
Jennings, I think we perfectly understand one another, and I'll not waste
any more of your time, for, of course,
you have many more amusing ways of
employing it. Good morning, Jennings, my boy-farewell."</p>

<p>The perfect radiation of cordiality
and good humour with which this
very peremptory dismissal was con-
veyed, was so incongruously discon-
certing, that Jennings felt totally un-
able to resent the procedure as he felt
disposed to do-for, truth to say, he
was more nettled than he cared to
confess, even to himself. Returning
the old gentleman's salutation, there-
fore, stiffly and coldly enough, he
withdrew, and had walked nearly
half-way along the side of St. Ste-
phen's-green (in the immediate neigh-
bourhood of which Sir Arthur resided)
before he began to recover the angry
confusion of this affronting <i>congé</i>.
Slackening his pace, however, he began
to revolve the occurrences in his mind,
and, with the resignation of necessity,
began to discover many things to be
grateful for among the consequences
of this explanation, <i>brusque</i> and unex-
pected as it undoubtedly was.</p>

<p>"Well, well," he muttered, "it is,
perhaps, much better as it is. She is
à devilish fine girl, to be sure, and, I
do believe, had well nigh turned my
head; but, egad, I was acting like a
<i>fool</i>--a ---- fool, to follow her about,
and get myself entangled at all--heaven
knows what an infernal piece of mischief it might have ended in, if I had
been left to my own foolish fancies--I'm a deuced deal a happier man, as
matters stand--a <em>safer</em> one, at all
events."</p>

<p>Jennings was a singularly handsome
young man, as we have said--very
vain and very selfish; he knew no
control except that involved in a punc-
tilious subservience to the code of
fashionable society in which he lived;
and, without any one grain of positive
malevolence in his disposition, he
had about him a great deal of the raw
material out of which circumstances
and opportunity might eventually fa-
bricate a villain; an inconsiderate im-
petuosity, too often mistaken for gene-
rosity and impulsive candour ; an
exacting and ambitious vanity, which,
ever seeking for new homage, inspired
a constant desire to please-and, with
the desire, stimulated the constant prac-
tice, too, of all the little arts of pleas-
ing and which, however despicable a
passion in itself, was yet, in its effects,
the prime cause of his popularity--
these, combined with a constitutional
selfishness which instinctively governed
all his views and actions, were the
leading attributes of a character-un-
fortunately for the dignity of human
nature-commonplace enough. Ex-
ternally, however, he was a very fasci-
nating person-accomplished, elegant,
agreeable, and blessed with an inex-
haustible flow of gay and sparkling
spirits.</p>

<p>Of course, it was to be presumed
that Sir Arthur had conveyed to
Miss Chadleigh his views respecting
Jennings' attentions; and the baronet's
stern and implacable severity in pu-
nishing disobedience, and enforcing
compliance with his commands, was
so thoroughly known and understood,
that not one of his children dared
openly to disobey his lightest order.
Mary Chadleigh and Jennings, how-
ever, were destined often to meet-in-
deed it could not be otherwise, unless one
or other of them had withdrawn from
that gay society in which both of them
mixed so freely. There was, however,
a very marked change in their mutual
demeanour. There was an obvious
reserve on her part; though ill-
natured people observed that her
eyes were oftener seen following his
movements in the crowded saloons
than was either to be accounted for
by pure accident, or altogether recon-
cilable with the show of coldness with
which she now habitually met him.
On his part, the change was also
marked; instead of devoting his at-
tentions and his time, as heretofore,
whenever fortune brought them toge-
ther, all but exclusively to her, he now
scarcely ever exchanged a dozen sen-
tences with her; in short, though the
female world good-naturedly persisted
in believing Miss Chadleigh a very ill-
used, and, spite of her assumed in-
difference, a very devoted damsel—yet
all were agreed that this affair was
totally and finally at an end.</p>

<p>It was not very long until gossip
began to busy itself once more with
this young lady's name-a new suitor
began to be suspected. Young Lord
Dungarret, with a coronet and twelve
thousand a-year at his disposal, was evi-
dently smitten, and to such a degree,
that Miss Chadleigh became ten de-
grees more ugly than ever in the eyes
of the female world of Dublin. While
matters were in this state, however,
it happened that one day, as Sir Arthur
sate in his chamber, damning his old
enemy, the gout, in solitary suffering
and ill-temper, somebody hesitatingly
knocked at his chamber door.</p>

<p>"Come in--well?" he exclaimed,
turning his mottled and gloomy visage
full on the intruder.</p>

<p>The person who entered was old
Martha, a privileged domestic of some
three-score years, who had been the
nurse, and was now the attendant of
Mary Chadleigh, whom she absolutely
idolized. "I'm come, sir, about the
young mistress," she said, approaching;
"for, indeed, I'm afraid she's very
bad-she's very sick, sir, and I would
not be easy without the doctor seeing
her."</p>

<p>"Sick-is she?" said the baronet;
"young ladies are always ailing-it's
interesting, and nurses always croak-
ing-they have nothing else to do; I
wish she had half-a-day's experience
of my gout-curse it and she'd know
what pain is like."</p>

<p>"Why, then, indeed, sir, she really is
bad, and very bad, I'm afraid, this time,"
said the woman, with dignified empha-
sis. "It is not, of course, for an old
woman like me, that's nothing to the
darling young lady, more than just
nursing her and taking care of her, to
be dictating to her own father, that,
of course, has more feeling for his
own child than the likes of me 'id have;
but all I say is, she is <em>really</em> bad,
and--</p>

<p>"Well, well, well-send for the
doctor, to be sure, and don't plague
me any more; and just tell him," he
added, as the old woman reached the
door, "if he finds anything seriously
amiss, that I will feel much obliged by
his looking in here, and telling me
what he thinks of her--do you
hear?"</p>

<p>In obedience to the summons, ac-
cordingly dispatched, Dr. Robertson,
as I shall call him, then in extensive
practice in Dublin, and who had been
for twenty years the physician in attend-
ance upon the family, arrived late in the
evening. He was a large, good-natured
man, with a rough voice, emphatic de-
livery, and a <i>brusque</i> and decisive manner--clear-headed and rapid--with a
thorough knowledge of the world, as
well as a consummate skill in his profes-
sion. With a very rough exterior, and
an occasional coarseness, and even seve-
rity of expression, Dr. Robertson was,
nevertheless, a kind and tender-hearted
man; and these sterling qualities had
served to secure him a vested interest
in the practice to which his reputation
had once introduced him.</p>

<p>It was, as I have said, late in the
evening, when a peremptory double
knock at the door announced the arrival of the physician. With brisk
and creaking steps he followed the
servant, who conducted him directly
to the young lady's chamber. The house
was a vast and handsome mansion;
and after ascending a stone staircase,
and passing a handsome lobby, he found
himself in a kind of antechamber, from
which the young lady's sleeping apart-
ment opened. Here he remained for
a moment, while old Martha went in
to prepare her young mistress for the
visit. After about a minute, she re-
turned, and intimated that Miss Chad-
leigh was ready.</p>

<p>Doctor Robertson accordingly entered. The young lady was lying
upon her bed, her face deadly pale,
except where two bright spots of hec-
tic crimson glowed with unnatural
warmth; her eyes were swollen with
tears, and as the physician approached,
she turned away from his well-known,
good-natured countenance, and hid her
face in the bedclothes.</p>

<p>"Well, well, my dear, what is all
this? Come, come, we'll make a cure
of you in no time--don't fret--we'll
have you well in a day or two."</p>

<p>Thus saying, in rough and kindly
tones, he took her hand, and as he felt
her pulse, continued—-</p>

<p>"And tell me where you feel amiss--there's a good child--don't sob--don't cry--I promise you it won't signify."</p>

<p>"Oh, doctor," she said, with her
face still averted, "I am very ill, and--and--in such wretched spirits."</p>

<p>Here the poor girl again burst into
tears; and while she was weeping, the
old nurse stole noiselessly out of the
chamber, and closing the door, walked
restlessly from one spot to another in
the outer room we have described;
now arranging a screen, now replacing
a chair by the wall, now stirring the
fire, but, with an abstracted and mise-
rable look, and wringing her withered
hands ever and anon in the intervals.
This had gone on with little variation,
except that the old woman occasion-
ally looked with an expression of in-
tense anxiety, and even horror, at the
door which concealed her young mis-
tress and her professional visitor from
view, when at last it opened, and
Doctor Robertson came out, buried,
as it seemed, in profound and painful
thought, and looking unusually pale
and agitated; he walked, by two or
three steps at a time, pausing, and oc-
casionally shaking his head gloomily
in the intervals, and sate himself
down in silence before the fire,
and ruminated for some minutes. At
last he stood up briskly, turned his
back to the fire, beckoned to the old
woman, and as she approached, raised
the candle, so that its light fell full
upon her face.</p>

<p>"Where do you sleep, Martha?"
he asked, abruptly.</p>

<p>"Where where do I sleep?" she
echoed, stammeringly.</p>

<p>"Ay, ma'am, <em>where<em>?" he repeated,
sternly.</p>

<p>"Why--why here, sir, here in this
room," she answered, with some confusion.</p>

<p>He fixed his eyes upon her sharply
for a few seconds, and then as abruptly said--</p>

<p>"And how does your mistress rest
at night, pray?"</p>

<p>"She rests--she rests--why, sir,
she rests pretty well, sir; but why do
you ask me?"</p>

<p>He continued to regard the old woman with the same steady scrutiny for
some seconds; at last she said, with an
affronted air, and rather an effort, for
she was, whatever the cause might be,
very much disconcerted--</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know, sir, what
you're looking at me that way for; a
body 'id think I was took for a thief."</p>

<p>"There-there-never mind," he
said, putting down the candle; "no
offence, nurse, no offence-go in to
your young mistress. Is there―ay,
there's pen and ink here-very well-
just go in, and I'll call you when I
want you.""</p>

<p>Accordingly, the old woman, mut-
tering and sniffing, hobbled into the
adjoining room, and closed the door,
unaccountably, as it seemed, both irritated and alarmed.</p>

<p>Doctor Robertson being left alone,
leaned, in deep reflection, for a minute
or two upon the mantel-piece; he
then glanced round the room, and ob.
serving another door in it, he walked
over, opened it, and looked out. It
commanded a landing-place upon a
back staircase.</p>

<p>"Ha!" said he, as he closed the
door, and returned to the fireplace,
whistling slowly, and with rather a
dismal countenance, a few interrupted
staves as he went, he sat down, and
after a brief pause exclaimed--</p>

<p>"Poor thing!--poor thing!--it must
not rest here. Dear me--dear me--how very strange--I must see her
again--humph!--perplexing, but--ay, ay--I'll see her again—-it <em>is</em> much
better."</p>

<p>So saying, he called Martha, gave
her some general directions about
preparing slops, &c., and telling her
to attend to these arrangements meanwhile, he once more entered his patient's chamber.</p>

<p>It was fully half-an-hour afterwards,
that Dr. Robertson knocked at Sir
Arthur Chadleigh's door.</p>

<p>"Poor little thing!" said he, after a
few introductory sentences, exchanged
at either side, she is seriously indis-
posed, feverish, and very nervous, and,
I fear, without an immediate pros-
pect of complete recovery. The best
thing to be done for her is, to keep her
from all excitement and agitation;
her hours must be early, and the fewer
visitors she sees the better. In short,
I have spoken to her very fully; she
is now in possession of my opinion,
and appears perfectly disposed to fol-
low my directions implicitly, so there
is little else to be done for the present,
than to permit her to do as she herself
shall desire. In the meantime, I will
look in from time to time, to see that
all goes on well."</p>

<p>"And pray, Doctor Robertson, how
soon may we expect her perfect re-
storation to health," said Sir Arthur,
and with a coarse chuckle he added,
"for egad, if a girl is to marry at
all, it won't do to have her locked up
long-there's no time like the present,
my dear sir, especially in the case of
youth and good looks,"</p>

<p>"True, Sir Arthur; very true,"
said the medical man; "but, in Miss
Chadleigh's case, it would not be safe
to undertake her recovery within any
limited time-she may possibly be well
in a few weeks, and possibly not for a
year; it is impossible to predict with
certainty; it is one of those doubtful
cases, which may go on for a very long
time, and which, at the same time,
may just as possibly take a good or an
ill turn within a fortnight."</p>

<p>"It's cursed provoking--the dear
child!" ejaculated Sir Arthur, petulantly, as he thought of Lord Dungarret and his twelve thousand a-year--"what do you say to a week or so in
the country?"</p>

<p>"Umph! I proposed that; but she
did not like it," said Doctor Robert-
son; "and her disliking it would make
the experiment mischievous instead of
useful: her nerves are as much affected
as her general health; so that we must
not contradict her fancies, or irritate
her on any account; she must be al-
lowed to choose for herself-except in
matters of essential importance; and
in those she has good sense enough to
defer implicitly to her medical adviser;
so I shall look in, from time to time,
and see that matters go on properly,
and report progress to you accordingly."</p>

<p>With these words he took his leave.
As Doctor Robertson was in large and
fashionable practice, Miss Chadleigh's
illness was soon generally known; some
said it was merely a ruse to complete
the reduction of Lord Dungarret ;
others, that she was broken-hearted for
love of the faithless Captain Jennings;
many pitied her, and some few sincerely
lamented her absence.</p>

<p>I recollect, about this time, strolling
into the theatre one evening with two
or three acquaintances. We took our
places in the back of a box, in the
next one to which I observed Jen-
nings. One of my party happened to
be acquainted with him, and the fol-
lowing conversation passed between
them a conversation which indirectly
threw a light upon some of the darkest
passages of his subsequent history--</p>

<p>"I say, Jennings, did you hear the
news about the Chadleighs?"</p>

<p>"No--what news?" he inquired,
quickly.</p>

<p>"Why, young Chadleigh told me,
not an hour since, a letter has come
from his brother Dick, whom we all
thought was killed and cut up in In-
dia; but far from it, he is perfectly
well, and returning home on leave."</p>

<p>"Good God! how extraordinary!—-I really am delighted to hear it!"
exclaimed Jennings, growing pale, nevertheless, and looking stunned and
alarmed, instead of overjoyed, as his
words implied.</p>

<p>"He has quite a tale of wonders to
tell about his escapes and all that,"
continued his informant; and so rattled on for a time, until, the curtain
rising, he directed his attention to the
stage.</p>

<p>Though Jennings immediately recovered his serenity of countenance,
he grew silent, and in a few minutes
withdrew from the theatre, leaving, in
my mind at least, impressions not very
favourable to the strength of his affec-
tions or the value of his friendship. I
did not then know the positive reasons
which he had for dreading his young
friend's return.</p>

<p>Time wore on--months passed away--still Doctor Robertson responded,
with gloomy uncertainty, to the
inquiries with which he was assailed
from all sides; and the general im-
pression began to be, that poor Miss
Chadleigh's recovery was becoming at
least a very doubtful contingency.
Such was the posture of affairs, when
your humble servant, who pens these
pages, was himself involved in an ad-
venture which it is necessary here to
detail.</p>

<p>I had left a pleasant party, some-
where about one o'clock at night, and,
without having positively transgressed
the limits of sobriety, I had taken just
wine enough to predispose me to em-
bark in any exciting enterprise which
might turn up. I was quite alone;
and, as the reader is probably aware,
the streets of Dublin were by no
means so safe at night-time in the pe-
riod of which I speak, as they now
are; but relying upon the sword,
which the fashion of those days made
a necessary appendage, and in whose
use I was a tolerably accomplished
proficient, I rather courted than
avoided such adventures as chance
might possibly present. And in this
spirit, instead of pursuing the open
streets, I threaded the narrow alleys
and back lanes with a careless sort of
swagger, and a pugnacious disposition,
the very remembrance of which, even
at this time of day, makes me blush
for the reckless folly of my youth.
The perversity of fortune was, how-
ever, in this instance, as in many others,
apparent silence and solitude encoun.
tered my advance. I was now just
entering, in my devious ramble, a
dingy stable-lane, whose entire length
was enlivened by but three twinkling
oil-lamps, whose dusky radiance
scarcely extended a yard around the
wooden posts that supported them.
This dismal and silent alley ran imme-
diately behind the west-side of St. Ste-
phen's-green; and I observed the
figure of a man walking up and down,
as it seemed to me, with cautious and
suspicious tread. I could perceive
nothing of him, however, in the dusky
light, except that, as he passed and
repassed immediately under one of the
lamps, its faint rays fell upon a broad-
brimmed hat, and a great-coat, in
which the figure was enveloped. My
vague suspicions were confirmed, by
observing that this man withdrew him-
self, with cautious haste, as I advanced,
and was soon lost to my sight. I was
standing, still looking in the direction
in which the figure had disappeared,
when a little wicket, in one of the
gates opening upon the lane, was drawn
back close to where I stood, and a sup-
pressed female voice inquired--</p>

<p>"Are you there?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered I, promptly; now,
for the first time, beginning to feel
that an adventure was coming, and in-
clined to bear my part in it to the
close, end how it might.</p>

<p>"Where?" repeated the voice.</p>

<p>"Here," I answered, approaching
the aperture.</p>

<p>A female, muffled in a cloak and
bonnet, was passing through the wicket,
and making me a sign to draw nearer,
she said, hurriedly,</p>

<p>"Here-take it-and then wait for
us where you are."</p>

<p>At the same time she placed a small
bundle in my hands, which I received,
nothing doubting that I was inno-
cently made a partner in some night
robbery, whose true accomplice was
the man whom I had seen walking to
and-fro, as I described, and for whom,
doubtless, the woman had mistaken
me. With a secret satisfaction at the
surprise I was about to give the party,
I held the parcel fast, and took a few
turns, up and down, before the spot
where I had received it, awaiting the
further progress of the affair.</p>

<p>While thus engaged, I was nearly
met, face to face, by the man whom I
had at first seen, and who, hearing
some noise, doubtless, at the appointed
place of rendezvous, had hurried back.
On descrying me, however, he in-
stantly retired as before; and I, fear-
ing to interrupt the current of the
adventure, forbore in anywise to ob
struct his escape. I had walked thus
back and forward, bundle in hand, for
eight or ten minutes, when the wicket
was opened once more, and the woman
I had spoken to already, stepped out
into the lane, and said--</p>

<p>"Stand back a little bit, an' follow us,
and don't for the life of you drop that."</p>

<p>Almost at the same time two other
figures came forth, muffled as care.
fully as the first, and I heard a female
voice from within the wicket, pouring
forth, as it seemed to me, prayers
and blessings, interrupted with sobs,
The door was cautiously closed from
the inside, and I heard the key slowly
and carefully turned in the rusty lock;
and as these sounds were audible, the
little party began to move forward,
while I, in obedience to orders, brought
up the rear, carrying the parcel care.
fully in my arms.</p>

<p>The person in the centre of the
three appeared to be feeble, and to
advance with pain, and as she did so,
leaned heavily upon the others.</p>

<p>Thus we proceeded, until we reached
the end of this lane, and turned into
another as solitary and ill-lighted. As
the party before me passed under the
lamp at the corner, one of the women
upon whom she in the middle was lean-
ing, exclaimed—-</p>

<p>"Give me <em>them</em>, my jewel; they
are better off where we are going."</p>

<p>And thus saying, she drew off two
or three rings that glittered upon the
fingers that pressed her arm, and slip-
ped them into her pocket. This done,
they relapsed into total silence, and,
full of curiosity for the issue, I followed
close upon their steps.</p>

<p>We had now walked, though very
slowly, for nearly ten minutes, when, in
a dark spot, close under a broad gate-
way, they stopped.</p>

<p>"Thank God, we are so far," said one
of the women; "sit down on that, my
darling, for a minute ;" and so saying,
she laid a shawl, which she folded up
in the fashion of a cushion, upon the
top of one of the short upright stones
which protected the corners of the
piers; and upon this rude seat, the
silent, and, as it seemed, exhausted fi-
gure, sank down. The woman who
had just accosted me, now beckoned
me to her, and taking the bundle from
me, said:--</p>

<p>"Now run down there, and bring
up a chair from the stand at the second corner."</p>

<p>She indicated the direction with her
hand, and I-exerting myself to the
full, as much as if I had had a personal
stake in the enterprise, in which I thus
found myself, through sheer wanton-
ness, actively involved-ran at my ut-
most speed upon the errand, and
quickly returned with the desired conveyance.</p>

<p>Into this, the feeble woman who
had been resting as I have described,
was hurried, and the chairmen having
received directions to follow the two
others, and I in turn to follow them,
we all trudged onward, for forty minutes and upwards, in absolute silence.</p>

<p>By that time we had penetrated con-
siderably beyond Werburgh-street, and
were now entering the Liberties, when
turning abruptly into a short, dark,
dilapidated street, the women stopped
in front of a tall, dingy house, and
after inspecting its exterior and inter-
changing a few words, they signed to
the chairmen to set down their con-
veyance. Some one had probably
been watching for its arrival, from
one of the many dark windows which
overlooked the street, for she who
had sate in it was hardly disengaged
from the chair, when the hall-door
was stealthily opened, and a grimy,
suspicious-looking girl, with a wretched
candle in one hand, and shading her
eyes with the other, peeped out.</p>

<p>"Give me that," said the woman
who had spoken to me, and who
seemed to have the command of the ex-
pedition, at the same time entering,
and taking the candle from her, while
she drew the door fully open.</p>

<p>"All right?" she added, inquiringly,
glancing significantly upwards.</p>

<p>"Ay, everything," rejoined the
other, sleepily; at the same time the
other two women entered and passed
silently on toward the stairs.</p>

<p>"Pay the men, now, and come in
yourself," added the same woman,
addressing me. I fortunately had
about me enough change to satisfy
the chairmen, which, as it seemed it
was my province to do, and having
dismissed them, I followed my con-
ductress into the house, and surren-
dered the bundle into her hands.</p>

<p>She turned the key in the hall-door,
and beckoned me into a dilapidated
wainscotted back-room, on the win-
dow-sill of which she placed the dipt
candle, which faintly lighted this in-
hospitable apartment, and pointing to
the only piece of furniture which
garnished its walls, a solitary, clumsy
chair, placed there, I suppose, in an-
ticipation of my arrival, she said-</p>

<p>"Wait there, my good man, till I
come back by-and-bye, and you know
the rest."</p>

<p>As she spoke to me, I for the first
time saw her countenance, which was
about as ugly and sinister a one as I
had ever beheld; very nearly resem-
bling the lineaments usually ascribed in
fairy tales, and other such authentic
records, to witches of the malignant
kind a yellow skin, hooked nose, a
wide mouth, with a few carious fangs,
and a marvellous prominence of chin,
gave additional effect to a pair of eyes,
whose fierce and rat-like vivacity seem-
ed scarcely reconcilable with the evi-
dent antiquity of her other features;
and though her head was somewhat
sunk upon her chest, yet her original
wiry activity seemed to have suffered
little abatement from years. This wo-
man's countenance, I confess, impress-
ed me most unfavourably with respect
to the object of these arrangements;
and I could not help entertaining a
vague and unpleasant suspicion of
meditated foul-play, and impending
mischief, as the glance of this ill-fa-
voured hag continued to haunt my
fancy long after she had left me to the
dreary solitude of the apartment.
There was something, perhaps, a little
wounding to the self-love of a young
man in being thus coolly set down, as
I clearly was, for a lackey; but this I
must do myself the justice to say, that
I was buttoned up in a great coat fa-
shioned more with a view to comfort
than to elegance; and provided with a
hat which had seen a great deal of
rough night-duty.</p>

<p>The interest I felt in the denoue-
ment of the adventure, however, pre-
vented my troubling myself much
about this; and seating myself, pur-
suant to the old woman's directions,
in the solitary chair, I was left alone
to keep watch in this singularly bleak
and comfortless apartment.</p>

<p>Insensibly I began to grow sleepy;
and, adjusting myself in as easy an atti-
tude as my uncomfortable position
would permit, I fell into an uneasy dose,
in which the ill-looking hag, who had
last left me, was in my sleeping fancy,
hovering about me, and offering me
share of the rings I had seen her take,
on condition of my being accessary to
some infernal crime, which she was
always on the point of confiding to
me, yet, somehow or other, never di-
vulged, when I was startled from my
dreams by a piercing cry. For a mo-
ment I forgot where I was; the sound
was still ringing in my ears, and the
candle, the snuff of which out-top-
ped its blaze, afforded but an im-
perfect and shadowy light. Full
of uneasy apprehensions, I walked
softly into the hall, and made my
way to the foot of the stairs, where I
stood, listening breathlessly for the
slightest sound of a human voice, but
in vain. I thought, indeed, I could
distinguish in some remote upper-
room the shuffling of feet, but of
this I could not, on account of the con-
stant rattling of the old window-frames
in the wind, be perfectly certain. After
waiting for a considerable time, I was
about to abandon my new position,
or to return to my post in the parlour,
when I once more distinctly heard the
same piercing cry of agony which had
at first startled me. Without one
moment's hesitation, I drew my sword,
strode by three-at-a-time up the stairs,
the cries continuing as I ascended;
and just as I reached the room from
which they were issuing, they subsided
into a moan, and I heard the tread of
steps as before. I rushed directly to
the door, sword in hand, and pushing
it open, was some paces towards the
centre of the chamber before I could
arrest my advance. I had good reason
to be astounded. A fire was lighted, and
several wax-candles were burning in the
room, and illuminated abundance of fur-
niture, somewhat dingy to be sure, but
still, as it struck me, comfortable and
respectable in appearance; there were
curtains carefully drawn across the
windows, a carpet on the floor, and a
large bed, at one side of which stood,
the one a little in advance of the other,
the two women I had accompanied,
now divested of their bonnets and
cloaks; at the other, Doctor Robert-
son; and in the bed itself, flushed, ex-
hausted, and as it seemed to me, well
nigh dying-heavens! could I believe
it-Miss Chadleigh herself.</p>

<p>I stood for several moments abso-
lutely petrified with amazement; and
those upon whose offices I had thus
unexpectedly intruded, in so warlike an
attitude, returned my look with a gaze
of scarcely less astonishment than mine.
The poor young lady, who lay quite
motionless, with her eyes just closed,
appeared, however, wholly unconscious
of the intrusion. Before I had re-
covered sufficiently from the stupefac-
tion of this extraordinary discovery,
Doctor Robertson had taken me
roughly by the collar, and drew me,
or rather pushed me out of the apartment.</p>

<p>In reply to his angry interrogatories,
which he had suppressed until I had
reached the lobby, I offered the best
explanation, namely, the simple truth.</p>

<p>"Robbers, indeed!" he muttered--"more likely to be one of the gang
yourself--"</p>

<p>And calling out one of the women,
and having exchanged a few words in
a whisper with her, I presume touch-
ing myself, he appeared satisfied, and
told me to get down again as fast as I
could, and to beware how I came again
where I was not wanted. Sustaining
as well as I could the character assign-
ed me, as it were, by common consent,
I conducted myself under this rebuke,
as a respectful lackey might be sup-
posed to do. I was so much shocked,
that on reaching the chamber where I
had been directed to wait, I could
scarcely collect my thoughts. Only
to think of Miss Chadleigh's being re-
duced to a situation so strange and
deplorable!-she whom I had last seen
the admired of all beholders-the life
and the ornament of the gay and ele-
gant society in which she moved.
Merciful heaven! how repulsive, de-
grading, and melancholy was the con-
trast. A prey to a thousand conflict-
ing and tumultuous feelings, I leaned
upon the old chimney-piece, gazing
into the black and empty grate, lost,
not in conjecture or surmise, but in
mere confusion, amazement, and, I
might almost add, consternation.</p>

<p>While thus engaged, I was tapped
on the shoulder by the old woman,
whose entrance I had not perceived.</p>

<p>"Poor young lady !" said I-"how
is she now?"</p>

<p>"Bad enough," said the woman—
"don't your hear her?"</p>

<p>"Poor thing! she seems very ill, in-
deed!" I answered.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," she repeated, with a
smile, for which I could have strangled
her, "it's all one, rich or poor, on
<em>that</em> bed. She's in the hands of God
now, an' nothing but Him and patience
to look to--"</p>

<p>"God help her-God help her !" I
repeated.</p>

<p>"Och, never a fear of her," said
she, snuffing the candle with her bony
fingers; and then putting her hand in
her pocket, she gave me a note, saying--</p>

<p>"You're to bring that to him the
minute the child's born; and mind,
you're to tell him--for the foolish
creature set her heart on it--that she
wrote it the very last minute she could
hold a pen, do you mind? and don't
go until I come back and tell you
whether it's a boy or a girl; though,
God knows, I don't see much differ it
makes."</p>

<p>With this remark she withdrew,
and I, with intense curiosity, approach-
ed the candle to read the address of
the billet. "Richard Hamilton Jen-
nings, Esq.," was written with a trem-
bling hand upon it, and, fortunately for
my incognito, his address in full sub-
scribed. I now began, for the first
time, fully to appreciate the extreme
awkwardness and embarrassment of
the very equivocal position into which
my precipitate folly had led me.
I had become possessed of a secret, in-
volving the reputations, perhaps the
lives of others, and by a coincidence
which, however purely accidental and
unpremeditated upon my part, I yet
could not help perceiving might, at the
same time, expose me to the most pain-
ful and disreputable surmises and mis-
construction. It was, however, too
late now to extricate myself, without
possibly doing still further mischief;
my now withdrawing could effect no
possible good; and, on the whole, I
judged it best to perform the services
committed to the domestic whose place
I had so foolishly taken, and then to
confide in Doctor Robertson (whose
character, as well as his appearance, I
perfectly knew, although I had no actual
acquaintance with himself), the exact
nature of my position in the affair, be-
lieving, and as I still think, with rea-
son, that it would be a relief to the
parties who had reason to dread being
compromised, to learn that their secret
accidentally divulged, had, at all events,
fallen into the keeping of a gentleman
and a man of honour.</p>

<p>I had hardly arrived at this resolu-
tion, when I heard the stealthy tread,
and the uneasy respiration of the old
woman on her return.</p>

<p>"Well, it's all over, an' a quick
case it was," she murmured, as she
entered. "She may well be thankful,
so she may, not to be undher them,
like many a poor creature that's bad
fur a night and a day, and longer."</p>

<p>"And how is she?" I urged.</p>

<p>"Och, well enough-as well as can
be," she answered--"right well. Don't
be delaying any longer; an' don't drop
the note, for the life of you. Tell him
it's a boy, an' a real plentiful boy; and
she's getting on elegant."</p>

<p>So saying, she hurried me to the
hall-door, and observed in conclu-
sion--</p>

<p>"Don't clap the door, do ye mind?
and if you have any message back,
don't knock loud-do you hear me?"</p>

<p>It was still profoundly dark, and
the streets silent and deserted. It was
past three o'clock, probably nearer
four, as I knocked at Captain Jen-
nings' lodgings. He had a handsome
set of apartments in Kildare-street,
and through the blinds of the drawing-
room windows I could see the glare of
lights, and the shadows of persons in
the room. The hall, too, was lighted;
and from the promptitude with which
the door was opened, as well as from
the talking and laughter audible from
the drawing-room, as I followed the ser-
vant up the stairs, it was manifest that
Captain Jennings was seeing company.</p>

<p>The servant was a novice in his
duties, I suppose; for instead of ac-
quainting his master with my arrival,
and leaving me to wait in the hall, he
ushered me up at once into his pre-
sence. Perhaps, indeed, by way of
compensation to my self-esteem, the
worthy fellow, with more discrimina-
tion than those whom I had last en-
countered, detected something of the
gentleman under my assumed lackey-
ism. In obedience to his directions,
therefore, and perhaps with some lurk-
ing curiosity to witness the contrasted
situation of himself and of his victim,
in the self-same hour, I stepped into
the room. It was light as day with
wax-lights, and the party, which con-
sisted of some eight or ten, were for
the most part engaged at cards. They
were all talking and laughing with
noisy gaiety; and an elegant supper
was laid, with a profusion of plate and
wine-coolers, at a long side-table.
One of the first persons I saw was
young Chadleigh, who was just con-
cluding a satirical anecdote as I enter-
ed, and the next was Jennings. I
saw the latter cast an angry glance at
the servant, and instantly resume the
smile with which he awaited the point
of young Chadleigh's story; but I
plainly perceived that in spite of his
command of muscle, his face had grown
almost deadly pale.</p>

<p>He waved his hand impatiently to
us to withdraw, and as I did so, I saw
him fill out a glass of wine. In the
midst of the buzz and laughter which
followed Chadleigh's anecdote, Cap-
tain Jennings joined me in the lobby,
and as he did so, I heard Chadleigh
call after him some quizzing insinua-
tion as to the nature of my message,
which, coming from that quarter, and
uttered in all the thoughtless levity of
gaiety and dissipation, sounded sadly
enough in my ear.</p>

<p>"Follow me," said Jennings, drily,
and led the way to the parlour. Plac-
ing the candle on the chimneypiece,
and standing close by the fireplace,
he signed to me to shut the door,
which I accordingly did; and when,
in obedience to another sign, I had
approached so near that our conversa-
tion could be distinctly carried on in
tones little above a whisper, he con-
tinued, with manifest tokens of agita-
tion--</p>

<p>"You came--you came from"--and
abruptly stopped, looking at me with
a pallid countenance, in which was
stamped the intensest anxiety.</p>

<p>"I come, sir, with this note and a
message," I replied, placing the letter
in his hand.</p>

<p>He broke the seal and read the note
hurriedly through, but without any
change of expression; then looked at
me with anxious abstraction for a
second or two, and once more read the
note through from end to end.</p>

<p>"And the--the patient," he added,
fixing his eyes on me again; "you
know--I suppose you know who she
is?"</p>

<p>"Yes--Miss Chadleigh," I replied,
with an effort.</p>

<p>"He knows it all," he muttered,
scarce audibly, and looking at me
still with the same abstracted and fear-
stricken expression. "And how is
she?" he asked after a pause—-“is she
safe?"</p>

<p>"She is doing well, sir," I replied;
"she is safely over her trial."</p>

<p>"That's well," he said, drawing a
long breath, as if relieved, but with-
out exhibiting any corresponding
cheer in the expression of his face."</p>

<p>"And the infant," I began.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, quickly, "what
of it?"</p>

<p>"Is also doing well," I replied-
"a boy, the nurse desired me to tell
you-a very fine boy, indeed."</p>

<p>"The nurse!" he repeated, while
his face darkened with renewed alarm
"What nurse? Why, my great
God! she's not mad enough-surely it
can't she's not <em>at home<em>?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, sir, very far from her
home, and not likely to be found
either," I replied.</p>

<p>He seemed relieved; again took up
the note, but replaced it on the table
unread, and turned, and leaned his
head on his hands on the chimney-
piece, as it seemed, either buried in
profound reflection, or wrung by some
sudden agony. After a while he turn-
ed about, and thrusting his hands into
his pockets, stood with his back to the
fireplace, and his head sunk forward.
The light of the solitary candle upon
the mantelpiece above him, deepened
with its shadows the furrows of his
contracted brow and down-drawn
mouth, He looked, I thought, the
very picture of comfortless and guilty
wretchedness.</p>

<p>I had conceived instinctively, almost
from the first moment I beheld him, a
certain feeling of dislike toward Cap-
tain Jennings, and this predisposition
my recent discoveries were, as you
may readily suppose, by no means cal-
culated to mitigate or remove. I could
not help saying, in a tone which, had
he been less agitated at the moment,
might very possibly have provoked his
anger-</p>

<p>"And may I ask, sir, have you no
message of any kind for the unfortu-
nate young lady?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, you're right; I forgot
to be sure," he answered, glancing
quickly and anxiously around him;
and then raising his hand in painful
reflection to his face, replied "You
are very right-a message-yes, yes,
yes."</p>

<p>As he said this, he mechanically
took up the note again, and looking
vacantly at it for a few seconds, threw
it, as it seemed, unconsciously upon
the table. My eyes followed it invo-
luntarily, and as it fell before me (it
is, I hope, needless to say, totally
without my intending it, and merely
in the accidental way in which the eye
is often irresistibly fascinated by, and
attracted to, exactly the object from
which we are most anxious to avert
it), I saw, and in some inappreciable
fraction of a second, actually read the
three first words of the note: they
were "Darling, darling husband."
Turning it hastily face downward, I
pushed it back again toward Captain
Jennings.</p>

<p>"Husband!" unworthy as I be-
lieved the man to be, you would
scarcely credit me were I to describe
the sense of relief and delight with
which my heart expanded as that one
word met my eye. It seemed as if the
voices of a thousand blessed angels
were repeating it in melody and gra-
tulations to my ear; in the glance
that revealed it to me, I saw a creature
rescued from the abyss of the dark-
est and most irretrievable of earthly
ruin, and standing pure and safe in
the light of heaven; iny heart swelled
within me, and tears rose to my eyes.</p>

<p>While those emotions agitated me,
Captain Jennings continued lost in
thought, and at last he said:--</p>

<p>"Ay, it is better to write;" and
tearing off the outer leaf of the
note which lay before him, he traced
a line or two with his pencil, but
checking himself, again paused, crum-
pled the note he had just commenced,
and that he had received, together,
applied them to the candle, and drop-
ped them blazing into the grate.</p>

<p>"Say that I will be with her as
soon as I can possibly get away,"
said he; "but where is the house-
where is she?" he added, suddenly.
I described by the land-marks with
which he was acquainted, exactly the
spot where the poor young lady was to
be found.</p>

<p>"Then, just say as I told you, that
I will be there without one moment's
avoidable delay."</p>

<p>Thus speaking, he hastily led the
way to the hall-door; for some of his
half-tipsy guests were beginning to
call for him, and, as it seemed, were
about making an exploratory excur-
sion from the drawing-room. Mut-
tering a broken curse upon them all,
he opened the door, and I heard him,
as I walked down the stone steps,
respond in tones of affected gaiety to
their clamorous challenge. With the
rapid pace which indicates an excited
mind, I retraced my steps; the bells
were chiming, and the watchmen
drowsily calling four o'clock, as I
approached the scene of my strange
adventure.</p>

<p>"Thank God, at all events," I
fervently murmured-"thank God,
the poor creature is not disgraced and
ruined; a strange, perplexing, and, I
fear, a most imprudent affair it un-
questionably is; but, after all, what an
escape!-how much to be thankful for!"</p>

<p>I had now reached my destination,
and was admitted. The young lady,
I was told, was doing well; so I de-
livered my message, and took my place
in the parlour as before, resolved to
await the departure of Doctor Ro-
bertson, who was still up stairs, and
to explain, as was my fixed intention,
the foolish accident which had involved
me in the affair; acquaint him with my
name and address, and assure him of
my secresy.</p>

<p>I had not waited very long, when I
heard him, with creaking steps, slowly
descending the stairs, issuing, as he
did, some parting directions to the
woman who attended him with the
candle.</p>

<p>"I shall look in in the evening,
after dark," he said; "everything
promises fairly,-so that will do; I'll
make my own way out; never mind—-good morning.”</p>

<p>As the worthy man uttered these
gruff civilities, I presented myself at
the foot of the stairs, and requested
a word with him in the parlour. Merely
directing me to be brief, and with a
prodigious yawn, he accompanied me
thither. I then proceeded to lay be-
fore him a full statement concerning
myself, and the causes of my partici-
pation in the business. He was first
disposed to be angry; but my own
frankness, and perhaps an old acquaint-
ance with my father, an intimate of
his youth, disarmed him, and my ex-
planation ended by his shaking me
good-naturedly by the hand.</p>

<p>"Egad, I believe I have been in
greater fault of the two, young gen-
tleman, in this affair," he said; "for
I undertook <em>my</em> part with my eyes
open; and a troublesome and an awk-
ward part it must e'en prove, at the
best. But," he added, in a changed
tone, with all its trouble and awk-
wardness, I would not have declined
it for a thousand pounds; poor little
thing; no, no; this was a matter of
life or death; the poor child reposed
confidence in me, and trusted me with
the secret of her situation, under the
seal of silence. I could not honoura-
bly divulge it; nor could I, with one
particle of common humanity, refuse
my aid; her life was in the balance;
she would have had none attend her
but me, and without proper assistance
must have died; to have declined
that aid, through any consideration of
consequences affecting myself, would
have been the act of a respectable
scoundrel; it would have been to per-
petrate a prudential murder."</p>

<p>As he spoke, there came a hurried
knocking at the hall-door.</p>

<p>"This must be Captain Jennings,"
I said.</p>

<p>"Umph! he must not go up sud-
denly; they must prepare her for the
meeting," said he; and, opening the
chamber door, he said to the atten-
dant--</p>

<p>"Shew Captain Jennings, if this be
he, into this chamber; and as soon as
you think the lady sufficiently reco-
vered to see him, you can tell him so."</p>

<p>With this direction, he re-entered
the room, and walked up and down
once or twice, with rather an inaus-
picious expression of countenance,
while he awaited the appearance of
the new visitor; he had not long to
wait; the door opened, and Captain
Jennings, muffled in a cloak, entered
the comfortless apartment.</p>

<p>Doctor Robertson received him
with a stiff nod. After a few brief
inquiries, rather drily answered, the
physician said, in reply to a significant
glance which Jennings had directed
toward me--</p>

<p>"You need have no apprehension on
account of <em>his</em> presence, Captain Jen-
nings; whatever you have to say to
me, may be said before him; he al-
ready knows all that is of moment in
this affair, and his honour may be re-
lied on."</p>

<p>"Honour!" repeated Jennings;
"so then he's a gentleman, as I sus-
pected."</p>

<p>"Permit me, Captain Jennings,"
said Doctor Robertson, "to recom-
mend to you, what I conceive honour
and common-sense alike indicate, as
the proper course to be pursued in
this painful affair. I have not had
until this moment, it is true, an op-
portunity of so much as even speaking
to you upon this subject, and do not
know, even if I had, that I was at
liberty to introduce it. I can have
now, however, no scruple in fully
telling you my mind; and I must
say, that the extreme imprudence into
which you have led an inexperienced
and fondly-attached girl, threatens
seriously to compromise her, not only
with her own relatives, but in the
eyes of the world. You have placed
her in a situation calculated, unless
it be at once explained, to prejudice
her reputation fatally; and I am
bound to say, as an old friend of the
family, that unless you come forward
frankly, and put Sir Arthur in pos-
session of the real state of facts, I
shall feel it my duty to do so myself."</p>

<p>"There is no need of any disclosure--at least <em>immediately</em>," said the young
man, hurriedly. Everything is ar-
ranged. No one but her old attendant
has access to her chamber at home,
and Sir Arthur and young Chadleigh
don't see her once in five weeks. They
don't suspect anything, and need not.
Is it not clear that an explosion—a
scene-just now, would be about the
worst thing in the world for her?"</p>

<p>"Very true," said Doctor Robert-
son, drily; "all very true; but if
there be an explosion, there is no need
it should reach her ears. No, no, sir.
Believe me, the only honourable course
now open before you, is that of promp-
titude and candour. You ought, with-
out the delay of an hour, to acquaint
Sir Arthur with the fact of your marriage."</p>

<p>"And who the devil--" began
Jennings, with a look which partook
at once of rage and terror.
The expression remained fixed for a time,
but the sentence died away unfinished;
and muttering some incoherent words,
he walked, with a sort of half-agitated,
half-defiant air, twice or thrice across
the floor, and stopping at the empty
fireplace, planted his foot upon the
bar, and stood looking vacantly into
the inhospitable grate, with an aspect
as black and cheerless as its own.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said Doctor Robert-
son, somewhat sternly, "you will, of
course, act as you think proper; but
I again advise you to be the first to
open this affair to Sir Arthur; for, as
I have already told you, he shall other-
wise learn it all from myself. I have
a very strong opinion about it.”</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," said Jen-
nings, petulantly; and continued, in a
haughtier tone, perhaps intended to
show Doctor Robertson that his fur-
ther pursuing the subject would be
considered impertinent-"By the
way, sir, I ought to have thanked you
before this for your able professional
assistance."</p>

<p>"Sir, I intended no obligation what-
ever to <em>you</em>. My interest is naturally
strongly engaged on the poor young
lady's account," replied Doctor Ro-
bertson, gruffly, as he buttoned up
his great-coat to his chin, and then drew
on his warm gloves; "for her I would,
if need were, do a great deal more."</p>

<p>He turned, stiflly and grimly, from
the young man, shook me again by
the hand, and took his departure.</p>

<p>Almost at the same moment, in obe-
dience to an intimation from the atten-
dant, Captain Jennings proceeded up
the stairs, to the chamber where the
young lady lay. As he followed the
matron up stairs, the wailing of a
new-born baby reached his ears. This
feeble and plaintive appeal to his ра-
ternal sympathies, was probably far
from welcome; for he looked as if, but
for very shame, he would have cursed
the helpless little creature; and now he
stood at the chamber-door. Perhaps
some touch of better feelings moved
him, for his look grew sadder and soft-
ened. He entered. Faint, and with
eyes half-closed, the fair young mother--her sore trial over--lay in the hush-
ed and darkened room. Weak and ex-
hausted as she was, a faint cry of joy
broke from her pale lips; and such a
look of ecstasy welcomed his appear-
ance, as must have moved a heart of
stone.</p>

<p>"Oh Richard, Richard--oh!
Richard," was all the poor creature
could say, as he stooped over the bed
and kissed her, with at least a show of
fondness; while her feeble arm was
clasped round his neck with an agony
of delight, as if she had never hoped
to have seen him again.</p>

<p>"Oh! Richard--Richard, darling!--it is you--darling, it is you!”</p>

<p>She clung to him, sobbing, and
smiling, and softly repeating words of
endearment, till, gently disengaging
himself, he kissed her again, clasped
her hand in his, and pressed it, and
wrung it fondly, as he sat by the bed-
side. Thus silently testifying his af-
fection, he leaned back, so that the
curtain interposed between his face
and hers. Two or three bitter tears
started down his cheeks, and such a
look of unutterable anguish darkened
his countenance, as might have sha-
dowed the eternal despair of the damn-
ed. Thus some minutes passed, while
he pressed the feeble hand he held with
a feverish grasp.</p>

<p>This interview was prolonged to
more than an hour; and at length
Jennings, warned by the approach of
the dawn, took his departure, in sore
disorder and dismay--his heart agitated
with a tumult of terrible passions and
sensations, his brain burning with a
thousand wild and irreconcilable plans
and projects--a thoroughly miserable
man.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I had returned to my
lodgings, and thrown myself into bed,
not to awaken to the remembrance of
my last night's strange adventure until
late in the day. It is, of course, un-
necessary to say, that I felt the in-
tensest curiosity respecting the pro-
gress and final <em>denouement</em> of this ex-
traordinary affair. The conclusion
was not long suspended.</p>

<p>Jennings had returned to his cham-
ber in Kildare-street; but repose for
him was out of the question. He had
spent hours of agonized uncertainty;
but at last his mind was made up, and
his resolution taken.</p>

<p>"I have but one course to take--necessity controls me--I have no choice
left," he muttered. "What infernal
influence could have possessed me!—-what accursed witchcraft can have
blinded and infatuated me! Great
God! what a serious, what a fright-
ful business, it is turning out. Well,
I suppose it was my destiny. I won-
der if the old fellow had any inkling
of my real situation when he forbid
me his house? Merciful Heaven! if
I had but acted then like a man of
common sense; but some accursed de-
lusion was over me. I had got inter-
ested and piqued in the pursuit. I
did not dream of mischief. I could
swear, with my dying breath, I never
meant harm, until accident and the
devil—-and poor, poor Mary herself—-put that accursed piece of madness
into my head. Curse my folly! It
is a desperate, a frightful situation;
but self-preservation is, they say, the
first law of nature; and were I even
to sacrifice myself, I don't see that she
would be essentially the better." He
consulted his watch, and continued--"My measures must be taken prompt-
ly; that meddling, doctor-fellow, will
be on the fidgets till he does mischief.
I can't be too prompt."</p>

<p>He rang the bell, directed the ser-
vant peremptorily to deny him to all
visitors, drew the window-blinds,
bolted the door, and then, seating him-
self before his desk, wrote, with pain-
ful attention and assiduity, for full
two hours, without rising. This task
completed, he carefully raised the
manuscript, making various erasures
and interpolations, and at last, folded
carefully, sealed it, and placing it in
his waistcoat pocket (in those days a
tolerably capacious receptacle), he
buttoned his coat across it.</p>

<p>"Will he <em>do</em> it?" he muttered,
doubtfully; "we'll see--we'll see. In
the first place, he may never be called
on to say a word, <i>pro</i> or <i>con</i>; in the
second, even if he be, <em>this</em> is as easily
said as anything else; and, in the
third, we will gild the pill pretty
thickly."</p>

<p>So saying, he opened a drawer in
the desk, and took out a handful of
guineas and a bundle of bank notes,
the spoils of his last night's successful
play.</p>

<p>"Let me see what have I got in
bank," he reflected; "I must leave
enough for <em>my</em> part of the business; it
would not do to be money-bound just
now. Ay, ay, he may have the
three hundred. I think three hundred
will be strong enough for him. Poor
Mary-poor Mary!"</p>

<p>Having counted out, in notes and
guineas, the sum he had named, he
rolled them up, and stuffed them into
his pocket; then muffling his face in
a shawl, and putting on his hat and
cloak, he sallied forth upon an expe-
dition, of the last importance to his
plans.</p>

<p><hr/></p>

<p>It was drawing towards evening,
upon the same day, when a servant
called at my lodgings with a note, and
sent up word that he waited for an
answer. I did not know the hand,
but expecting an invitation, never-
theless, I broke the seal eagerly, and
read the following-to a very different
purport, as you may perceive:--</p>

<p><span>"Kildare-street.</span></p>

<p><span>"Captain Jennings presents his
compliments to Mr. and trusts
that he will pardon the liberty which,
under very peculiar circumstances, he
takes, in venturing to entreat the fa-
vour of his (Mr. -'s) presence for
a few moments, upon a matter of the
utmost importance, as respects an
affair in which he has already evinced
an interest. Captain Jennings has an
engagement for this evening, but will
be at home till seven o'clock; and
will esteem it a real obligation if
Mr. ---- will honour him with a call
at any time before that hour."</span></p>

<p>I instantly wrote a civil answer,
complying with his request; and, full
of impatience for the result, I prepared
to follow the messenger without losing
a moment.</p>

<p>My preparations were quickly made,
and I was soon in the street, and tra-
versing the intervening space between
mine and Captain Jennings' lodgings
at a rapid pace. As I turned the
corner of Nassau-street, I met my friend ----,
a notorious gossip in his
day. I perceived, by his at once
taking my arm, and turning about
with me, that he had a story to tell,
and was rather shocked at his opening
sentence--</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of the
affair in Stephen's-green?--of course
you have heard it all--about the
Chadleighs; a shocking piece of
business, upon my life--a devilish
fine girl, too--a great pity."</p>

<p>I affected surprise, and asked the
particulars.</p>

<p>"Somewhere about twelve o'clock
to-day," he said, "old Sir Arthur
received an invitation-at least so I'm
told, for I have not yet had time to
sift the matter myself-an invitation
for himself and Miss Chadleigh, they
say, to old Lady ----'s, down in
what-d'ye-call-it--that place in Kil-
dare, you know; and they say--egad,
I can scarce help laughing, though I'm
devilish sorry too--they tell me her
ladyship mentioned, by way of induce-
ment, that young Lord Dungarret, an
admirer, as it was thought, of Miss
Chadleigh, was to be there; and this
consideration determined the old boy
to accept it, come what might, though
his daughter had been ailing for a
long time. And so he took his crutches,
and hobbled up to her room, where he
had not been for a month before, to
tell her ha ha!-his sovereign will
and pleasure; but, egad, the old boy
had his hobble for nothing, for, rat
me, the bird was flown, the cage was
empty; the invalid had absconded,
the fair lady had fled; how, why,
whither, or with whom, remains a
profound secret."</p>

<p>"And when did she go?" I asked,
anxious to ascertain how far the par-
ticulars were known.</p>

<p>"Oh, last night, and it is supposed
by the back way," he replied;
"it was devilish well managed--a clever
girl, sir--a deep scheme."</p>

<p>"Do they suspect the purpose or
the companion of her flight?" I in-
quired.</p>

<p>"The purpose!--poh, poh! that's
plain enough; I have not heard yet
who was the gallant gay- -but I
forgot to tell you, by-the-bye, the old
fellow-old Sir Arthur-put himself
into such a devil of a frenzy, when he
found it out, that he got a sort of a
fit a devilish bad fit, I am told.
Poor old fellow! he is a deuced deal
too purple and bull-necked to stand
excitement. I should not be a bit
surprised if he's done for-regularly
done for. There goes Dr. Robert-
son's carriage-egad, direct to Ste-
phen's-green, too; I venture an even
guinea, he's going straight to shave
and blister old Chadleigh. You know
he's their family physician-a great
oddity, a perfect character. I'm told
Lady Chadleigh, poor woman! used
to say, whenever----by the way,
it's odd how things run in the
blood-there's Miss Chadleigh just
taking after her mother, a run-away
already."</p>

<p>Here he broke off, for, seeing a
friend at the other side of the street,
he hastened across to tell the news to
a fresh listener, and leaving me op-
portunity enough, for we had just
reached the corner of Kildare-street,
and for many reasons, I had no wish
that he should see me enter Jennings'
lodgings.</p>

<p>What I had just heard, satisfied me
that the catastrophe, whatever it might
be, was certainly not far distant; and
with a degree of anxiety proportioned
to the imminence of the event, in
which I could not help feeling the pro-
foundest interest, I knocked at the
hall-door, and was promptly shewn up
stairs, and found myself vis-a-vis with
Captain Jennings.</p>

<p>I found him in his dressing-gown
and slippers. He looked pale and
anxious, but had quite recovered his
coolness and self-possession by this
time.</p>

<p>"I feel that I have taken a great
liberty, in giving you so much trou-
ble," he continued, after the usual
salutations had been interchanged, and
I had taken a chair; but, with the
exception of Doctor Robertson, with
whom my acquaintance is just as slight
as with you, I have no other gentle-
man to apply to in this most unhappy
affair"--(here he slightly shrugged his
shoulders, with an air of chagrin and
discontent, which somehow impressed
me more than all that had yet passed,
with a conviction of that callous sel-
fishness which I believed to be the
basis of his character)--"You and
Doctor Robertson are alone acquainted
with the particulars of this business,
and you will, I trust, forgive the pre-
ference which makes me, not, perhaps,
unnaturally, select you, rather than
him, as the depository of the only
confidence I have to make."</p>

<p>He said this in his most engaging
and conciliatory manner; but, as I
bowed in acknowledgment of the pre-
ference, I felt my original dislike of
him rather increased than abated.</p>

<p>"I offer no defence whatever for
my conduct; God knows I blame my-
self as severely as anybody else can
possibly do," he continued, with a
contrite shake of the head; "I ran
blindly into extreme temptation, and
have compromised, not only myself,
but a young lady, whom I would
gladly die to extricate from the un-
fortunate position into which I have
unguardedly led her."</p>

<p>Equivocal as had been his agitation
that morning, it was, at all events,
genuine; but now he had recalled all
the artificial graces of his manner. I
saw in the polished ease of his remorse,
and in the studied melancholy of his
compassion, something indescribably
repulsive and abominable.</p>

<p>"Without further tasking your pa-
tience," he resumed, at the same time
taking a paper from his desk, "I have
to entreat your consent to become the
depository of this paper. It is a piece
of evidence which may throw an im-
portant light upon this affair; the
copy of a document, which I keep in
my possession, and which you will,
perhaps, oblige me by retaining in
yours; the nature of it you will see at
a glance, and I have endorsed upon it
the name and address of the party
whose testimony it is, so that, if need
be, there can be no difficulty in apply-
ing it properly. All I ask of you is,
to guard it equally from destruction,
and from the eyes of all others, but
yourself; and that, whenever I write
to you to that effect, you will kindly
hand it to my law-agent in town,
whom I will name to you, whenever
it becomes necessary to employ one.
Will you kindly undertake this com-
mission?"</p>

<p>I could hardly decline an office, as
it seemed, so easily performed. I so
little liked the applicant himself, how-
ever, that a slight, and not very gra-
cious hesitation, preceded my accep-
tance of its duties. He thanked me,
however, profusely; and I had risen
for the purpose of taking my depar-
ture, when a vehicle of some kind
stopped at the hall-door, and a thun-
dering double-knock announced the
arrival of a visitor.</p>

<p>"Tell them I'm dressing," said
Jennings to the servant, who appeared
at the room-door; and, in the next
moment, the summons at the hall-door
was answered.</p>

<p>"Captain Jennings is dressing for
the evening," I heard the servant say,
in reply to the inquiry of the foot-
man who had knocked.</p>

<p>This intimation, however, had not
the desired effect, for the steps of the
carriage were let down with a sharp
clang, and, almost at the same moment,
I heard a different voice, that, I pre-
sumed, of the visitor in person, demand--</p>

<p>"Is your master at home?"</p>

<p>The same answer was repeated, and
the applicant for admission replied in
a sharp decisive tone--</p>

<p>"Ha! dressing for the evening,
very good; then he <em>is</em> at home?"</p>

<p>"But, sir, I beg pardon; he po-
sitively cannot see anybody at pre-
sent," urged the man.</p>

<p>"He shall certainly see me," re-
torted the visitor, in the same tone.
"I know the way--don't mind."</p>

<p>From the moment the clatter of the
carriage-steps smote my ear, my mind
unaccountably misgave me, and a fore-
boding of impending collision and mis-
chief, filled me with an almost painful
suspense. My instinctive apprehen-
sions did not deceive me. The draw-
ing-room door was pushed abruptly
open, and young Chadleigh entered
the room.</p>

<p>The moment I saw him, I perceived
that in his face which warned me of
the truth of my vague anticipations.
Pale, stern, and collected, he walked
slowly a few steps into the room,
bowed with an ominous and icy for-
mality to Captain Jennings, and, in
a tone so cold and deadly, as I think
I never heard before, or since, said—-</p>

<p>"Captain Jennings, I presume you
apprehend the subject of my visit?"</p>

<p>It was scarcely necessary to put the
question. He had advanced to receive
Chadleigh with his usual air of frank
and easy gaiety, their eyes met, and
in the encounter he read the truth-
the smile passed away in an instant
from his countenance, and was suc-
ceeded by a look, to the full as stern
and ominous as that which confronted
him. The young men felt that a
deadly quarrel lay between them, and
I think I never saw a more portentous
greeting.</p>

<p>"You have not announced it, sir,"
said Jennings, with cold and mea-
sured politeness; "but I have no hesi-
tation in saying, that I <em>do</em> suspect the
cause of your visit."</p>

<p>"Good, sir!" replied Chadleigh, in
the same constrained voice; "I came
on behalf of Miss Mary Chadleigh's
father, and in my own right, as her
brother, to demand of you, in the first
place, where that young lady at pre-
sent is."</p>

<p>"Without meaning to dispute your
right to put that question," replied
Jennings, "I mean to stand upon mine,
to decline answering it."</p>

<p>"You refuse to answer?" said
his visitor, while his countenance
darkened.</p>

<p>"I do--most distinctly refuse," re-
peated he.</p>

<p>"Pray, think better of it, sir," re-
torted Chadleigh, with a ghastly mi-
micry of courtesy.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chadleigh,” replied Jennings,
haughtily, "I recommend you strongly
to act as a man of the world in this bu
siness. The mischief, whatever it be,
is now past cure. If you will only
allow events to take their course, scan-
dal may be avoided, and a great deal
of unnecessary trouble, exposure, and
violence spared. If you will persist in
pushing this matter to extremity, do so;
upon your head be the consequences."</p>

<p>"Sir," said Chadleigh, "you greatly
mistake me, if you fancy that your
mean and perfidious conduct, in spi-
riting away the daughter of a gentle-
man, who frankly told you that he
peremptorily declined the connexion
which your conduct seemed to offer--if you fancy that your base and mer-
cenary conduct in inveigling her, a
young lady entitled to a fortune, and
with most suitable prospects before
her, into a marriage with you, a mere
adventurer--"</p>

<p>"Mr. Chadleigh, before you pro-
ceed further, let me ask you, <em>have</em> you
actually made up your mind to push
this affair to a public quarrel?" in-
sisted Jennings.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," retorted Chadleigh,
proudly and bitterly. "Mary Chad-
leigh has selected for herself--em-
braced her own degradation--married
a man whom her father expressly for-
bid his house, because he suspected
him of entertaining the schemes he has
but too securely realized. She is now,
and henceforward, to Sir Arthur and
to me, a stranger; we renounce and
disown her; and by ----, she shall
not stand between you and the punish-
ment you deserve." He paused; and
added emphatically--"I presume you
will be at home by eleven o'clock to-
night?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir," answered Jen-
nings, calmly.</p>

<p>His visitor bowed sternly, and began
to withdraw.</p>

<p>"I wish, if you please, to add one
word," said Jennings.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Chadleigh, re-
turning.</p>

<p>Jennings looked down for a moment,
in agitated and guilty abstraction-bit
his lips, and grew deadly pale, as
though inwardly agonized with a
mortal struggle.</p>

<p>"I have to request your attention,
too, Mr. ----," he said, addressing
me, and arresting my departure. "It
is, unfortunately, due to myself that
you should hear what I am about to
say."</p>

<p>"Be so good as to say, without
further delay, what you desire me to
hear," said Chadleigh.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; you have forced me to
it," said Jennings, drawing himself up,
and looking with a steady, and singularly evil scowl, full in his visitor's face. "You talked of marriage?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Chadleigh.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, as you will have it a
quarrel between us, it is, unfortu-
nately, due to myself to say, that there
is no such thing as marriage in the
case."</p>

<p>Jennings spoke these words with a
resolute and measured distinctness,
which left no room for misapprehen-
sion.</p>

<p>"No!--no marriage!" said Chad-
leigh, after a hideous pause of some
seconds, and speaking almost in a
whisper, like one half-stunned, while
he returned the guilty gaze of his
transformed friend with a stare of ac-
tual horror.</p>

<p>For my own part, I confess I was
scarcely one degree less astounded than
Chadleigh, at this utterly unlooked-for declaration.</p>

<p>"Not married--not married! Why,
great God, can it--is it credible! You
monstrous, measureless villain ———”</p>

<p>The flimsy varnish of affected cour-
tesy was gone, and the hell-born pas-
sions it had masked broke forth in an
instant, in undisguised and titanic re-
velation. With one hoarse execration,
shrieked rather than spoken, Chad-
leigh advanced toward Jennings.</p>

<p>"Take care, Chadleigh-take care;
I would not harm you," said Jennings,
sternly.</p>

<p>"Hold, for God's sake," I cried,
interposing between the two young
men. "Mr. Chadleigh, I implore of
you--remember, consider; what can
come of this?"</p>

<p>"Let me go, sir," cried Chadleigh,
hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jennings," I cried, still cling-
ing to Chadleigh, for in his furious
paroxysm of excitement, I could not
tell what dreadful results might pos-
sibly attend a physical encounter, "for
God's sake, avoid this; you'll have
bloodshed else. Mr. Chadleigh, re-
flect; stay for one moment."</p>

<p>"Let me go, sir; let me go, or by ----,
I'll strike you down," cried
Chadleigh, straining and struggling to
reach the object of his fury.</p>

<p>"Get into your room, Mr. Jen-
nings, unless you wish for murder.
Go, for Heaven's sake," I repeated.
"I can't prevent it longer. I tell you
go-go, in God's name. <em>Will</em> you go,
or not?"</p>

<p>Jennings' momentary agitation had
entirely disappeared with the imme-
diate menace of such an encounter as
that which threatened him. His phy-
sical courage no one had ever doubt-
ed; and the moment <em>it</em> was tasked,
his intrepid calmness instantly return-
ed. He hesitated for a second; then,
with one glance of mingled remorse and
disdain at Chadleigh, he turned, and
strode sullenly into his chamber, fling-
ing the door close after him. The key
was, fortunately, in the outside; and,
without giving Chadleigh time to get
before me, I sprang to the door, lock-
ed it, and, placing the key in my
pocket, stood facing the baffled as-
sailant.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said bitterly, "by ----,
you shall answer for this."</p>

<p>"When and how you please, Mr.
Chadleigh," I replied, sadly. "I have
done my duty, and no more, in pre-
venting a murderous fray; and I thank
God I have succeeded."</p>

<p>He stood undecided for a few se-
conds. At last he said--</p>

<p>"Perhaps you were right, sir; and
<em>I</em> ought to ask <em>your</em> pardon. You were
right, sir, and I was wrong. Pardon
me."</p>

<p>I gave him the assurance he requir-
ed, and he added abruptly—-</p>

<p>"This is no place for me.
Good night, sir."</p>

<p>So saying, he left the room; and I,
from the window, saw him re-enter
the carriage, and drive away, ere I
returned to turn the key in Jennings'
room. I did so, and called him; there
was no answer. I pushed the door
open a little, and looked in. He had
thrown himself into a chair, and was
sitting close by a table, his forehead
laid upon his arm, and his face con-
cealed—he was sobbing. He started
up abruptly, on becoming aware of
my presence, and with a violent effort
commanded himself.</p>

<p>"Mr. ----," said he, "pray don't
leave me, for a few minutes. Mr. ----,
you don't know what I am suffering,
and what I have suffered. I am about
the most miserable and unfortunate
mortal you have ever seen or heard of--indeed I am. Sir, you can't under-
stand--I can't explain to you the hor-
rors of my position."</p>

<p>"The poor young lady," I said,
coldly, "is certainly impressed with the
belief that she is legally married. Dr.
Robertson distinctly told me so-nay,
he himself believed it."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, yes," he interrupted,
vehemently; "but I can prove it
is not so. The paper I have placed
in your hand will show you that
there has been no such thing. She
thinks it--she believes, no doubt,
poor creature; but she's wrong--quite
wrong."</p>

<p>I was greatly shocked at the sinister
eagerness with which Jennings labour-
ed to impress this fact, which, of all
others, I thought he ought naturally
to be most anxious to conceal for the
present, upon my conviction; and I
could not forbear saying--</p>

<p>"At all events, you will not fail to
make all the reparation now in your
power, and--"</p>

<p>"What reparation ?" he asked, ve-
hemently.</p>

<p>"There is but one," I answered,
"which you can now offer; and that
is, <em>marriage</em>."</p>

<p>"You are right, indeed," he an-
swered, sullenly, after a long pause;
"it is the only-the <em>only</em> reparation
for such a wrong."</p>

<p>He sank into a moody and com-
punctious silence. At last he said,
abruptly--</p>

<p>"They talk of generosity, and im-
pulse, and all that, but take my word
for it, <em>prudence</em> is worth them all.
My own utter want of reflection has
done it. I have been drawn into a
situation in which I am powerless, at
least for good; but do me justice, sir;
you <em>must</em> do me justice, for, by ----,
I designed no wrong; I am not a cold-blooded wretch. I was led away by
passion--misguided and betrayed into
a position, as I told you, where I am
no longer a free agent, and then my
conduct is criticised, as if I could do
just as I pleased. Is this justice or
honesty? I'm railed at like a cold,
scheming villain, and damned for not
making reparation--I, that never laid
a deliberate plot in my life, or hesi-
tated to make atonement where I
could. By heavens, sir, I tell you
truth. Is this fair dealing--is it can-
dour--is it common toleration?"</p>

<p>I reminded Jennings that I had no
right to judge in the matter; and also
intimated that I had already staid too
long, and so rose to take my depar-
ture.</p>

<p>"Well, well, well," he said, with a
dreary sort of shrug; "patience, and
shuffle the cards-who knows what
may turn up-who knows? Though,
egad, take it which way you will, it
is about as cursed, black a looking
business, as ever man was in for. It
is hard--hard, by ----. It looks as
if they were all in a savage conspiracy
to ruin me; and what good, in the
devil's name, can come of it-a pack
of fools!"</p>

<p>I now took my leave. A feeling of
curiosity, and, still more strongly,
one of intense interest in the unfortu-
nate young lady, with whose fate he
was so disastrously connected, had
tempted me, minute after minute, to
prolong my visit. It was already
nearly dark, and the street-lamps were
burning. I had reached the corner of
Grafton-street, buried in profound ab-
straction, when I was suddenly ac-
costed by a familiar voice. It was
that of my friend Fitzgerald, a wild
fellow, and a pleasant one to boot, and
an accomplished adept in all the then
important mysteries of the small-sword
and pistol, and learned in all the lore
of points of honour.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me," said he, after
our greeting, and taking me at the
same time by the arm, and drawing
me with him, "whether Dick Chad-
leigh has got into a scrape?"</p>

<p>What kind of a scrape do you
mean?" I asked, evasively.</p>

<p>"Why, he called on me when I was
out, not half-an-hour ago," he replied,
"and left a hurried note, telling me
I must go to him without a moment's
delay, on my return, about a little
business. Now, there is but one kind of
business I understand"--here he raised
his arm once or twice significantly, as
if balancing a pistol--"and I strongly
suspect it must be upon that he has
called me to counsel; all my friends
make use of me, you know, on such
occasions. Have you heard anything
of Chadleigh's being likely to want
my services in <em>that</em> way-eh?"</p>

<p>I told him I knew that high words
had passed between him and Captain
Jennings.</p>

<p>"Jennings--ho, ho!" said he, with
a serious air--"a cool hand, I fancy.
Egad, from the little I've seen of him,
I'm inclined to think, if he is the man,
it will be a matter of flints and pow-
der--egad, it does look like business."</p>

<p>I was not at all sorry to comply
with Fitzgerald's suggestion, to the
effect that I should await his return
in Brown's coffee-house, and end the
evening there in his company. My
anxiety to learn the issue of the busi-
ness was such, that I would gladly
have done much more to satisfy it.
Accordingly, I dropt into that public
resort of idleness, while Fitzgerald,
having called a coach, rumbled away
to his interview with Chadleigh.</p>

<p>"I had sat there for considerably
more than an hour, and was beginning
to give up all hope of his return, when
he entered.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, when we had
established ourselves at a table apart
from the rest, "I have had a couple
of odd-devilish odd conversations-
since I saw you. I don't know, in-
deed, whether I am at liberty to tell
you the subject of the quarrel."</p>

<p>I interrupted him by assuring him
that I already knew it; and having
satisfied him upon this point, he pro-
ceeded to detail the particulars, which
I shall condense for the benefit of the
reader.</p>

<p>He had, it seemed, found Chadleigh
still much excited, and quite deter-
mined upon a hostile meeting; indeed,
so resolute upon the point, that he
would not so much as hear of any-
thing to the contrary. His directions
were peremptory, and amounted simply
to this--that arrangements for a meet-
ing were to be completed without a
moment's delay. All details, of course,
were left to the direction of his friend;
with respect to the quarrel itself, how-
ever, he was not invested with any
right of diplomacy. Finding Chad-
leigh thus implacably resolved, Fitz-
gerald undertook the affair, which for
other parties he had so often filled with
singular efficiency, and was duly invest-
ed with the important functions of a
"second" in the affair. Leaving Chad-
leigh, however, and being still of opi-
nion that, if possible, the matter ought,
for every reason, to be quietly adjust-
ed, he resolved, upon his own respon-
sibility, to make one final effort to
prevent a catastrophe which, even if
unattended by any more tragical con-
sequences, must, at all events, have
the effect of irreparably disgracing
Miss Chadleigh. His belief was, that
there remained one chance, and one
only, of saving the unfortunate young
lady, and that was, a private marriage
with the author of her shame, accom-
plished without the delay of a single
hour, if possible, so that the public
might hear of the elopement and the
marriage at one and the same time.
Filled with this project, Fitzgerald
hurried up the stairs of Jennings'
lodgings. The servant announced him
as he entered the drawing-room. Jen-
nings had altered his purpose, and de-
termined, after what had passed, to
remain at home. He was still in his
dressing-gown, and, when his visitor
entered, was sitting before his open
desk, the candles burning beside him,
and what seemed like a miniature in
his hands. He was looking intently
upon it, with no very loving aspect,
when Fitzgerald entered; but he has
tily thrust it, face downward, among
the open letters, which lay in multi-
tudinous confusion in the profundity
of the old-fashioned desk, and shut-
ting all up quickly, he locked it fast,
and rose to receive him. Fitzgerald
observed, also, that some torn papers
were burning on the fire, and Jen-
nings glanced quickly towards them,
to see that they were actually de-
stroyed.</p>

<p>"I have the honour, Captain Jen-
nings, to wait upon you with a com-
munication from Mr. Chadleigh," said
Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>"Pray, sir, take a chair," said Jen-
nings, coldly, and with a formal bow.</p>

<p>Fitzgerald complied, and resumed--</p>

<p>"I need scarcely, I apprehend, de-
tail the reasons which have induced
this step. You have already had an
interview with my principal, Mr.
Chadleigh."</p>

<p>"There is certainly no occasion, sir,
to say more. I do perfectly under-
stand the nature of your visit, which
I have, indeed, been expecting; and
have only to say, as Mr. Chadleigh has
pushed matters to extremity, I appre-
hend your instructions are very brief,
and that our present business may
be quickly arranged; if you will fa-
vour me with your card, my friend
shall wait upon you at whatever hour
you name.</p>

<p>"To say the truth, Mr. Jennings,"
replied Fitzgerald, "you are right in
supposing that my instructions have
been very brief in a word, they were
those of absolute and unconditional
hostility; this, however, is a case of
such very peculiar delicacy-a case in
which forbearance is so eminently im-
portant so imperatively called for by
all the circumstances, that I have re-
solved to take a responsibility upon
myself, and endeavour to arrange
this matter amicably, if, indeed, it be
possible."</p>

<p>Jennings continued to regard him
with earnest attention, but did not
speak.</p>

<p>"In short, as far as my influence
goes, I would guarantee such an ad-
justment, upon one condition, which
you can have no possible objection in
submitting to that you repair the
dishonour you have done Miss Chad-
leigh, by <em>marrying</em> her, before her
present unhappy position becomes
public."</p>

<p>Jennings grew deadly pale, and his
features seemed to contract with the
intensity of acute suffering, as he
gazed for a few seconds upon the
speaker, and then, abruptly rising,
with a gesture like wringing his hands,
he turned towards the fire, and re-
mained standing for a time with his
face averted.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," exclaimed Fitzgerald,
after a pause of considerable surprise-
for he had expected a prompt and
grateful acceptance of his proffered
interposition--"what do you say—-what am I to understand?”</p>

<p>Jennings heaved a dreary sigh,
and said, gloomily and desperately
enough--</p>

<p>"What you propose is absolutely
out of the question--impracticable.”</p>

<p>“Then, sir, take the consequences,"
said Fitzgerald, with irrepressible in-
dignation; "you have, at least,
quieted my scruples in acting against
you--there is but one way of settling
the matter now."</p>

<p>"Just so, sir," said Jennings, who
had recovered his haughty coldness;
" and, as I must leave details to the
discretion of my friend, I have only
to ask you at what hour precisely it
will be convenient to you to see him?"</p>

<p>Fitzgerald named ten o'clock that
night, and placed his card in Jennings'
hand.</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," replied the lat-
ter, having glanced at it; “I presume
that both parties are equally anxious
to have this affair concluded with all
possible despatch; my friend shall
attend at the appointed hour."</p>

<p>With these words they parted.</p>

<p>"I don't know how it is," said
Fitzgerald, after he had concluded
his narrative, "but this thing has put
me quite out of spirits-it is a bad
affair, a d---d bad business; and, mark
my words, so sure as you sit there,
one or other of them will lose his life
by it; they are both of them game--game to the back-bone--game every
inch, sir; and Chadleigh is in a mur-
derous, black temper, too. Somehow,
this is the first business of the sort,
I ever had a hand in, that made me
mopish; d---n me, but it smells all
over of death and winding-sheets."</p>

<p>As the mortal crisis of this strange
tragedy approached, my interest in
its <i>denouement</i> became more and more
intense. At my entreaty, Fitzgerald
undertook to let me know, so soon
as they were completed, the detailed
arrangements for the approaching
duel. As he had sundry preparations
to make, he was obliged to leave me,
and I walked home, in dejected soli-
tude, to my lodgings.</p>

<p>I was no sooner alone in my apart-
ment, than I recollected the paper
which had been entrusted to my care
by Jennings. He had not only omit-
ted to prohibit its perusal in my case,
but had actually told me, in so many
words, that I was at liberty to read
it. There was, therefore, no impedi-
ment to the honourable gratification
of my curiosity; and, secure from in-
terruption, I proceeded to examine
the document.</p>

<p>It purported to be a statement of
certain occurrences, in connexion with
a clandestine visit made by the de
ponent, one "Benjamin Cruise, clerk,
resident next door to the Cow and
Cleaver, in Smithfield, in the city of
Dublin;" at the solicitation of Mrs.
Martha Keating, at the house of Sir
Arthur Chadleigh, in St. Stephen's-
green. The narrative was to the effect,
that the reverend gentleman in ques-
tion was applied to, on or about a
certain day, nearly a year preced-
ing the date of the document in ques-
tion, to attend at the back entrance of
the said mansion; where, according to
arrangement, he waited until about
one o'clock, when he was admitted,
and conveyed with great precaution
up a back-stair, and into a chamber,
where was a young lady, as it seemed,
in much agitation; and whom, as he
was then and there informed by the
old woman, his conductress, he be-
lieves to have been Miss Mary Chad-
leigh; by which name, he was after-
wards directed to marry her to a cer-
tain young gentleman, whom he now
knows to be Captain Jennings, and
who, shortly after his, Cruise's ar-
rival, joined the party in the said
chamber, with like caution; that he,
Cruise, had then, at the desire of the
party, proceeded to unite Miss Chad-
leigh and Captain Jennings, accord-
ing to the ritual of the Church of
England; and that a noise in another
part of the house having alarmed
them, the ceremony was interrupted
in the introductory part, and before
the giving of the ring; and he and
Captain Jennings, were together hur-
ried out from the house the same way;
and, that he never before, or since
then, saw Miss Mary Chadleigh, and
knew not of her having been mar-
ried by any other clergyman. This
statement, which was given with great
aggravation of detail, was duly dated,
and signed in full, by the reverend
gentleman, in those days, a not very
creditably-notorious personage.</p>

<p>The perusal of this document im-
pressed me still more unfavourably
respecting Jennings. There was some-
thing sinister and equivocal about the
whole thing. The infamous character
of the degraded man who signed it;
the industrious detail with which it
had been prepared; and, above all, the
unaccountable precaution which had
suggested the adoption of such a mea-
sure, filled me with painful mis-
givings, to the effect that some gross
and horrible delusion had been prac-
tised upon poor Miss Chadleigh; and
I could not forbear deeply regretting,
that I had suffered myself, under con-
ditions of secrecy, to be made the
depository of so suspicious a docu-
ment.</p>

<p>I was pursuing this unsatisfactory
train of reflections, when a note was
placed in my hand; it was couched
in the following terms:--</p>

<p><span>"Dear ----,</span></p>

<p><span>At seven o'clock to-morrow morn-
ing, on the Fifteen Acres.</span></p>

<p><span>"Yours in haste,</span></p>

<p><span>"FITZGERALD."</span></p>

<p>I spent a restless night, and was
up long before dawn. Having com-
pleted my toilet, I walked some way
into town, in the grey twilight of
coming morning; and when I had, as
I calculated, consumed the greater
part of the necessary interval, I got
into a hackney-coach, and drove di-
rectly to the place of rendezvous.
Availing myself of a screen of bushes,
I stopped the carriage, and got out,
unobserved from the scene of action.
As soon as I obtained a view of the
ground, I observed there a coach, and
a little group of three persons, who
were standing, listlessly, close beside
it; two or three gentlemen on horse-
back-mere spectators, of course, like
myself were also on the ground. I
walked as near as I decently could to
the group I have mentioned, and saw
that Chadleigh and Fitzgerald were
two of the number. The latter looked
at his watch, and mounted the coach-
box, to command a more extended
view; shading his eyes with his hand,
he looked along the skirting of wood
which bounds the place, in the direc-
tion of the city, and at last his eye
seemed to settle upon a distant object.
I followed the direction of his gaze,
and saw the top of a carriage moving
in the distance.</p>

<p>"Here," I thought, "comes Jen-
nings; which of them is to leave the
field unhurt, and which--" I shrank
from the inquiry, merely mental as it
was, with something like a shudder.</p>

<p>"Poor Mary Chadleigh! whichever
way it ends, its issue must be, to her,
a tragedy."</p>

<p>Fitzgerald had descended from his
post of observation, and recognizing
ine, he walked up, and shook me by
the hand. He looked pale and stern.</p>

<p>"They are coming," said he,
glancing towards the vehicle which
was now rapidly approaching.</p>

<p>"Rather late--are they?" I asked—-more from want of something to say
than any other cause.</p>

<p>"No, no; a quarter past seven was
fixed on, subsequently to my note,
last night; we should scarcely have
had light earlier," he said.</p>

<p>"The weapons are pistols?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered; "and we
may as well begin to make our prepa-
rations. Come with me; you'll not be
in the way; I won't stand on ceremony
when the time comes for you to with-
draw and leave Major Gurney and
myself to our deliberations.”</p>

<p>So saying, he drew me with him to
the side of the carriage.</p>

<p>"Take out the case," he said to the
man who stood by the carriage-door;
not that--those are the instruments;
leave it where Dr. ---- placed it--the
<em>flat<em> case--that's right; just keep it in
your hand; and when I beckon to you,
bring it over to me quickly; there,
don't shake it."</p>

<p>We now walked up to Chadleigh,
who stood moodily and doggedly, with
his surtout buttoned up to the chin;
and exchanging, now and then, a brief
word or two with his companion-a
slim, pale-faced, young surgeon, who
was, evidently, but one degree less
frightened than if he had been himself
a principal. Fitzgerald dropped my
arm as he approached, and leaving
me at a little distance, observed, con-
sulting his watch--</p>

<p>"Eight minutes before their time."</p>

<p>Chadleigh nodded.</p>

<p>"They have brought advice, too,"
suggested the little surgeon, timidly;
"there is a second carriage."</p>

<p>"There's no need to waste time,"
said Chadleigh; "we had better walk
on a little to meet them."</p>

<p>The steps of the first carriage had,
by this time, been let down; and Jen-
nings, followed by a stiff, elderly gen-
tleman, with a red, important face,
and a military air, descended upon
the turf. After, as it seemed, a few
directions to the servants, they began
to walk towards us, briskly, followed
by an attendant, carrying a pistol-
case; and with the carriage, which
carried their medical friend, a little
in the rear.</p>

<p>My heart swelled within me as those
two little groups approached one ano-
ther, in grim silence, over the smooth
sward. Gracious God! what an awful
account for eternity was to be closed
ere they parted!</p>

<p>On they came, briskly and steadily,
through the keen and misty morning
air-nearer and nearer-until the in-
terposing space became so limited that
each party, as it were, by mutual
consent, slackening their pace, came
slowly to a halt, at some dozen steps
apart, and interchanged, in silence,
a stern and formal salutation. Fitz.
gerald stept forward, and was met
about half-way by the grim elderly
gentleman whom I have described.
After another salutation, as formal,
they withdrew a little, and conducted
a brief conference, in short, decisive
whispers. Meanwhile, those who,
either accidentally, or by design, had
been spectators of the proceedings,
began to gather about the spot on
which the combatants were placed.</p>

<p>I had thought, once or twice, that
Jennings perceived my presence, and
now I was assured of it.</p>

<p>"Mr. ----," he said, in a low,
hurried tone, "I have a request to
make."</p>

<p>"Pray, state it, sir," I replied, ap-
proaching.</p>

<p>"It is just this--should I happen
to fall, remain here for a few moments,
as I may feel it necessary to make a
communication to you of the last im-
portance, not to myself, but to
others."</p>

<p>I undertook to comply with this
request, and withdrew.</p>

<p>There was not the slightest percep-
tible tremor, not the least indication
of excitement, in his manner, voice,
or aspect, excepting that he was, per-
haps, a little paler than usual, and his
eyes were unusually dilated. With the
restlessness of suspense, I walked to
the spot where Chadleigh was stand-
ing, and, almost at the same moment,
Fitzgerald returned.</p>

<p>"What is the distance?" asked
Chadleigh.</p>

<p>"Ten paces," rejoined Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>"Too much," said he, gruffly.</p>

<p>"It is the usual thing; you don't
want to have us look blood-thirsty,"
retorted Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>"And for that reason, I'd like to
have it settled one way or other at the
first shot."</p>

<p>"It will be settled time enough,"
said the second, and, unlocking the
pistol-case, he proceeded to load the
weapons; a silence, hardly broken by
a whisper, followed, during which the
click of ramrods, and the cramming
home of wadded bullets were omi-
nously audible.</p>

<p>"Are you ready, Mr. Fitzgerald ?”
inquired Jennings' second;" if so,
we had better place our men at once."</p>

<p>"A piece of money was thrown up
for choice of ground; Jennings won.</p>

<p>"Luck's so far with us, sir; I hope
it may not turn," remarked the ve-
teran, with a ghastly jocularity.</p>

<p>Chadleigh disencumbered himself of
his surtout, and the combatants took
their ground respectively.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said the major, ad-
dressing the spectators, "have the
goodness to draw back a little; some
of you may be hurt, else."</p>

<p>The suggestion was complied with,
and a breathless silence followed.</p>

<p>"Are you ready, gentlemen," in-
quired the major.</p>

<p>Each answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p>After a brief pause the word "fire"
was given, each raised his weapon, but
Chadleigh only fired. Jennings must
have had a narrow escape, for he
shook his head, put his hand to his
ear, as if a hornet had stung him,
then, quickly raising the pistol, he fired
into the air, threw the weapon up,
and caught it by the muzzle as it de-
scended.</p>

<p>“D---e, sir, that won't do," ex-
claimed Chadleigh, in a tone of bitter
exasperation, you may throw away
your shot, if you will, but I'm cursed
if you get out of the business on these
terms; it is the act of a poltroon and
a scoundrel to sneak out of a quarrel
that way; I'll baulk your scheme,
for you--"</p>

<p>"Don't say a word," said Jennings,
sternly, interrupting Fitzgerald, who
was about to interfere, "I call you
all to witness I have stood his fire,
and without returning it—-that's all ;
let him take the consequences of his
vindictive obstinacy. I'll not stand
to be shot at like a target; I've a
right to defend myself, and by ----
I'll do it."</p>

<p>Certainly; 'tis very just and sen-
sible; the very point I was going to
put," said the major, with a brisk
approval, that strongly contrasted
with the savage intensity of Jennings'
tone.</p>

<p>It was plain that the angry and
mortal passions of combat were, in
Jennings, at last thoroughly aroused.
I heard him say to Major Gur-
ney, once or twice, impatiently,
"make haste," and saw him dart one
or two lowering glances at Chadleigh.
The preliminaries for a second ex-
change of shots were completed in a
few moments-the signal was given-
and both fired so exactly together, that,
from the report, one would have be-
lieved the explosion a single one. Jen-
nings' shot was well directed, though
accident defeated its aim; it struck
the trigger guard of Chadleigh's pis
tol, which was nearly forced from
his hand by the shock, and glancing
off, the ball buried itself in the sod.
Jennings, on the other hand, stood
immovable, while one might slowly
count three, then staggered a little,
dropped his pistol, and fell suddenly
to the ground. Chadleigh walked
forward a few hesitating steps, checked
himself, and, in an agitated voice, said
to the surgeon who had accompanied
him--</p>

<p>"You may be wanted here-by ----
he's hurt! Fitzgerald, come
away--come, I say."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, amid a babel of conflict-
ing and exciting suggestions, the sur-
geon, ordering the crowd to stand
back, had the wounded man raised a
little on the carriage cushions, and was
proceeding to examine the injury, but
Jennings said, faintly--</p>

<p>"Don't-don't-it's all of no use."</p>

<p>He invited me, with a glance and a
slight gesture, to approach.</p>

<p>"One word," he said, speaking
with great difficulty. I stooped down,
to bring my ear as near him as I
could. "It's all a lie--all that--the
paper--see the man, and tell him I
said so--poor Mary--I made him do it,
but I could not help it--there's no use
in maintaining the cheat any longer--I'm dying. Keep him away," he con-
tinued, faintly turning his gaze for a
moment on the surgeon, who was ap-
proaching, and then on me, "he can
do nothing for me--only listen to me--my last word—-that paper is--is a
lie--we were married--I can--I can
scarcely speak--don't--don't-—are you
going--hold me--oh God!"</p>

<p>I can never forget the look that
Jennings fixed on me--the fearful,
imploring gaze of his dilated eyes,
filled with the wild, deep, awful mean-
ing of death--the strangling effort to
speak--the ghastly pallor--and then,
the dropping of the jaw--the mouth,
through which the breath of life was
never more to stir, helplessly agape--the eyes, with the deep earnestness of
their awful meaning, fixed for ever--and the stern movelessness of the
darkened brow. Was this the gay,
vain, reckless Jennings? Was this
mute but fearful monitor of death,
propped-up before us, indeed the fri-
volous, light-hearted, sensual man of
the world, among whose dreams and
calculations the warning shadow of
death had never glided?</p>

<p>"By ---- he is dead," said one of
the by-standers, breaking the breath-
less silence that had followed.</p>

<p>The surgeon kneeled down beside
him, placed his hand over the dead
man's heart, raised his arm, and held
his pulse for a moment-then replaced
the hand by his side in silence. I re-
member seeing the grass that he had
plucked, dropping from the stiffening
fingers.</p>

<p>"Lift the body into the carriage,
and drive to Kildare-street," said
the physician, addressing the servants.</p>

<p><hr/></p>

<p>Poor Mary Chadleigh was long
held in ignorance of this, to her, over-
whelming catastrophe. At length,
however, it could be no longer con-
cealed; and the revelation was fol-
lowed by a brain-fever, which first
threatened her life, and then her rea-
son. She recovered, however, with a
mind unimpaired, although with a
shattered constitution. With her
younger brother and her child, the
youthful widow found an asylum for
years in England, until the death of
Sir Arthur put her in possession of the
fortune which his will could not con-
trol.</p>

<p>One circumstance connected with
the history of Jennings' fate, how-
ever, never reached her ear. I had
taken care to procure, though not
without considerable difficulty at start-
ing, the fullest evidence of the mar-
riage--and afterwards learned, from
the younger brother, whose return
had, perhaps, precipitated the catas-
trophe, a circumstance which ac-
counted for what had, for a time,
appeared to me the gratuitous villany
of Jennings, in himself denying, and
suborning others to deny, a marriage,
whose existence was necessary to pro-
tect Miss Chadleigh from the agoniz-
ing degradation, the appalling ruin,
with which she had been so immi-
nently, though unconsciously, threat-
ened. Jennings, it seemed, had ac-
tually married a woman of very equi-
vocal rank, and more than equivocal
character, in India. There were cir-
cumstances, however, which made the
validity of this marriage doubtful,
and the woman herself had left him,
and formed a vicious connexion there;
so that he had regarded the marriage
as dissolved by mutual consent, and
never reckoned upon the remote con-
tingency of her turning up, by any
accident. By a fatal coincidence,
however, it happened, that, of the
few individuals who knew of this con-
nexion, his intimate and confidential
friend, Captain Chadleigh, had been
one. His supposed death had, how-
ever, quieted those alarms, which
would have precluded the moral pos-
sibility of Jennings' hazarding the au
dacious step which ended so fatally for
himself, and the unexpected and im-
pending return of Chadleigh was the
first event which recalled the reckless
and unprincipled man to a sense of his
actual position. How often is crime
unavailing for its meditated purpose,
and effective only for the ruin of him
who plans it. While Jennings was
stoutly denying his marriage with
Mary Chadleigh, to avoid the fancied
danger of a prosecution, the poor
young lady's brother was bringing with
him tidings of the death (long pre-
vious to his marriage with Miss Chad-
leigh) of the profligate woman, whose
claim upon his hand had driven him
to the selfish and desperate expedient
of denying his union with the too-
confiding creature whom his ardent
and impetuous pursuit had won to
life-long sorrow. Yet I have lived to
see the offspring of this inauspicious
marriage, Arthur Chadleigh, a mem-
ber of parliament, and the sole inheri-
tor of the great Chadleigh estates in
Ireland.</p>
